The cumuli","That peeped above the mountain-tops would burn","Carmine a space; the cirrus-whorls on high,","More delicate than sprays of maiden fern,","Streak with pale rose the peacock-breasted sky,","Then blanch. As water-lilies fold at night,","Sank back into themselves those plumes of fervid light.","","And they would watch the first faint stars appear,","The blue East blend with the blue hills below,","As

into the wondrous west","Round vales of Proserpine and islands of the blest.","","So dusk would come and mingle lake and shore,","The snow-peaks fade to frosty, opaline,","To pearl the doméd clouds the mountains bore,","Where late the sun's effulgent fire had been","Showing as darkness deepened more and more","The incandescent lightnings flare within,","And Night that furls the lily in the glen","And twines impatient arms would fall, and then---and then . . .","","Sometimes the peasant, coming late from town","With empty panniers on his little drove","Past the old lookout when the Northern Crown","Glittered with Cygnus through the scented grove,","Would hear soft noise of lute-strings wafted down","And voices singing through the leaves above","Those songs that well from the warm heart that woos","At balconies in Merida or Vera Cruz.","","And he would pause under the garden wall,","Caught in the spell of that voluptuous strain,","With all the sultry South in it, and all","Its importunity of love and pain;","And he would wait till the last passionate fall","Died on the night, and all was still again.","Then to his upland village wander home,","Marvelling whence that flood of elfin song might come.","","O lyre that Love's white holy hands caress,","Youth, from thy bosom welled their passionate lays","Sweet opportunity for happiness","So brief, so passing beautiful---O days,","When to the heart's divine indulgences","All earth in smiling ministration pays","Thine was the source whose plenitude, past over,","What prize shall rest to pluck, what secret to discover!","","The wake of color that follows her when May","Walks on the hills loose-haired and daisy-crowned,","The deep horizons of a summer's day,","Fair cities, and the pleasures that abound","Where music calls, and crowds in bright array","Gather by night to find and to be found;","What were these worth or all delightful things","Without thine eyes to read their true interpretings!","","For thee the mountains open glorious gates,","To thee white arms put out from orient skies,","Earth, like a jewelled bride for one she waits,","Decks but to be delicious in thine eyes,","Thou guest of honor for one day, whose fêtes","Eternity has travailed to devise;","Ah, grace them well in the brief hour they last!","Another's turn prepares, another follows fast.","","Yet not without one fond memorial","Let my sun set who found the world so fair!","Frail verse, when Time the singer's coronal","Has rent, and stripped the rose-leaves from his hair,","Be thou my tablet on the temple wall!","Among the pious testimonials there,","Witness how sweetly on my heart as well","The miracles of dawn and starry evening fell!","","Speak of one then who had the lust to feel,","And, from the hues that far horizons take,","And cloud and sunset, drank the wild appeal,","Too deep to live for aught but life's sweet sake,","Whose only motive was the will to kneel","Where Beauty's purest benediction spake,","Who only coveted what grove and field","And sunshine and green Earth and tender arms could yield---","","A nympholept, through pleasant days and drear","Seeking his faultless adolescent dream,","A pilgrim down the paths that disappear","In mist and rainbows on the world's extreme,","A helpless voyager who all too near","The mouth of Life's fair flower-bordered stream,","Clutched at Love's single respite in his need","More than the drowning swimmer clutches at a reed---","","That coming one whose feet in other days","Shall bleed like mine for ever having, more","Than any purpose, felt the need to praise","And seek the angelic image to adore,","In love with Love, its wonderful, sweet ways","Counting what most makes life worth living for,","That so some relic may be his to see","How I loved these things too and they were dear to me.","","I sometimes think a conscious happiness","Mantles through all the rose's sentient vine","When summer winds with myriad calyces","Of bloom its clambering height incarnadine;","I sometimes think that cleaving lips, no less,","And limbs that crowned desires at length entwine","Are nerves through which that being drinks delight,","Whose frame is the green Earth robed round with day and night.","","And such were theirs: the traveller without,","Pausing at night under the orchard trees,","Wondered and crossed himself in holy doubt,","For through their song and in the murmuring breeze","It seemed angelic choirs were all about","Mingling in universal harmonies,","As though, responsive to the chords they woke,","All Nature into sweet epithalamium broke.","","And still they think a spirit haunts the place:","'Tis said, when Night has drawn her jewelled pall","And through the branches twinkling

the gold,","It has time to be sweet and grow old,","To triumph and leave not a leaf","For witness in winter's sight","How lovers once in the light","Would mix their breath with its breath,","And its spirit was quenched not of night,","As love is subdued not of death.","","In the red-rose land not a mile","Of the meadows from stile to stile,","Of the valleys from stream to stream,","But the air was a long sweet dream","And the earth was a sweet wide smile","Red-mouthed of a goddess, returned","From the sea which had borne her and burned,","That with one swift smile of her mouth","Looked full on the north as it yearned,","And the north was more than the south.","","For the north, when winter was long,","In his heart had made him a song,","And clothed it with wings of desire,","And shod it with shoon as of fire,","To carry the tale of his wrong","To the south-west wind by the sea,","That none might bear it but he","To the ear of the goddess unknown","Who waits till her time shall be","To take the world for a throne.","","In the earth beneath, and above","In the heaven where her name is love,","She warms with light from her eyes","The seasons of life as they rise,","And her eyes are as eyes of a dove,","But the wings that lift her and bear","As an eagle's, and all her hair","As fire by the wind's breath curled,","And her passage is song through the air,","And her presence is spring through the world.","","So turned she northward and came,","And the white-thorn land was aflame","With the fires that were shed from her feet,","That the north, by her love made sweet,","Should be called by a rose-red name;","And a murmur was heard as of doves,","And a music beginning of loves","In the light that the roses made,","Such light as the music loves,","The music of man with maid.","","But the days drop one upon one,","And a chill soft wind is begun","In the heart of the rose-red maze","That weeps for the roseleaf days","And the reign of the rose undone","That ruled so long in the light,","And by spirit, and not by sight,","Through the darkness thrilled with its breath,","Still ruled in the viewless night,","As love might rule over death.","","The time of lovers is brief;","From the fair first joy to the grief","That tells when love is grown old,","From the warm wild kiss to the cold,","From the red to the white-rose leaf,","They have but a season to seem","As rose-leaves lost on a stream","That part not and pass not apart","As a spirit from dream to dream,","As a sorrow from heart to heart.","","From the bloom and the gloom that encloses","The death-bed of Love where he dozes","Till a relic be left not of sand","To the hour-glass that breaks in his hand;","From the change in the grey garden-closes","To the last stray grass of the strand,","A rain and ruin of roses","Over the red-rose land."],"linecount":"86"},{"title":"Tiresias","author":"Algernon Charles Swinburne","lines":["PART I","","It is an hour before the hour of

hours to come;","","Ye forces without form and viewless powers","That have the keys of all our years in hold,","That prophesy too late with tongues of gold,","In a strange speech whose words are

hear change moving on them, and the chime","Across them of reverberate wings of hours","Sounding, and feel the future air of flowers.","","The wind of change is soft as snow, and sweet","The sense thereof as roses in the sun,","The faint wind springing with the springs that run,","The dim sweet smell of flowering hopes, and heat","Of unbeholden sunrise; yet how long","I know not, till the morning put forth song.","","I prophesy of life, who live with death;","Of joy, being sad; of sunlight, who am blind;","Of man, whose ways are alien from mankind","And his lips are not parted with man's breath;","I am a word out of the speechless years,","The tongue of time, that no man sleeps who hears.","","I stand a shadow across the door of doom,","Athwart the lintel of death's house, and wait;","Nor quick nor dead, nor flexible by fate,","Nor quite of earth nor wholly of the tomb;","A voice, a vision, light as fire or air,","Driven between days that shall be and that were.","","I prophesy, with feet upon a grave,","Of death cast out and life devouring death","As flame doth wood and stubble with a breath;","Of freedom, though all manhood were one slave;","Of truth, though all

life once given","No force of theirs hath competence to take;","Life that was given for some divine thing's sake,","To mix the bitterness of earth with heaven,","Light with man's night, and music with

and darkness all through day.","","Mother, that by that Pegasean spring","Didst fold round in thine arms thy blinded son,","Weeping \"O holiest, what thing hast thou done,","What, to my child? woe's me that see the thing!","Is this thy love to me-ward, and hereof","Must I take sample how the gods can love?","","\"O child, thou hast seen indeed, poor child of mine,","The breasts and flanks of

the very tongue of wisdom said","What grace should come with death to Tiresias,","What special honour that God's hand accord","Who gathers all men's nations as their lord.","","And sometimes when the secret eye of thought","Is changed with obscuration, and the sense","Aches with long pain of hollow prescience,","And fiery foresight with foresuffering bought","Seems even to infect my spirit and

streams","And with the inevitable years, and weep;","For how should he who communes with the years","Be sometime not a living spring of tears?","","O child, that guided of thine only will","Didst set thy maiden foot against the gate","To strike it open ere thine hour of fate,","Antigone, men say not thou didst ill,","For love's sake and the reverence of his awe","Divinely dying, slain by mortal

sorrow-shaken kind,","Nor as these are am I the prophet blind;","They have not life that have not heart to give","Life, nor have eyesight who lack heart to see","When to be not is better than to be.","","O ye whom time but bears with for a span,","How long will ye be blind and dead, how long","Make your own souls part of your own soul's wrong?","Son of the word of the most high gods, man,","Why wilt thou make thine hour of light and breath","Emptier of all but shame than very death?","","Fool, wilt thou live for ever? though thou care","With all thine heart for life to keep it fast,","Shall not thine hand forego it at the last?","Lo, thy sure hour shall take thee by the hair","Sleeping, or when thou knowest not, or wouldst fly;","And as men died much mightier shalt thou

brows a wind blowing from far?","Aches not thy forehead with a future star?","","The light that thou may'st make out of thy name","Is in the wind of this same hour that drives,","Blown within reach but once of all men's lives;","And he that puts forth hand upon the flame","Shall have it for a garland on his head","To sign him for a king among the dead.","","But these men that the lessening years behold,","Who sit the most part without flame or crown,","And brawl and sleep and wear their life-days down","With joys and griefs ignobler than of old,","And care not if the better day shall be -","Are these or art thou dead, Antigone?","","PART II","","As when one wakes out of a waning dream","And sees with instant eyes the naked thought","Whereof the vision as a web was wrought,","I saw beneath a heaven of cloud and gleam,","Ere yet the heart of the young sun waxed brave,","One like a prophet standing by a grave.","","In the hoar heaven was hardly beam or breath,","And all the coloured hills and fields were grey,","And the wind wandered seeking for the day,","And wailed as though he had found her done to death","And this grey hour had built to bury her","The hollow twilight for a sepulchre.","","But in my soul I saw as in a glass","A pale and living body full of grace","There lying, and over it the prophet's face","Fixed; and the face was not of Tiresias,","For such a starry fire was in his eyes","As though their light it was that made the skies.","","Such eyes should God's have been when very love","Looked forth of them and set the sun aflame,","And such his lips that called the light by name","And bade the morning forth at sound thereof;","His face was sad and masterful as fate,","And like a star's his look compassionate.","","Like a star's gazed on of sad eyes so long","It seems to yearn with pity, and all its fire","As a man's heart to tremble with desire","And heave as though the light would bring forth song;","Yet from his face flashed lightning on the land,","And like the thunder-bearer's was his hand.","","The steepness of strange stairs had tired his feet,","And his lips yet seemed sick of that salt bread","Wherewith the lips of banishment are fed;","But nothing was there in the world so sweet","As the most bitter love, like God's own grace,","Wherewith he gazed on that fair buried face.","","Grief and glad pride and passion and sharp shame,","Wrath and remembrance, faith and hope and hate","And pitiless pity of days degenerate,","Were in his eyes as an incorporate flame","That burned about her, and the heart thereof","And central flower was very fire of love.","","But all about her grave wherein she slept","Were noises of the wild wind-footed years","Whose footprints flying were full of blood and tears,","Shrieks as of Maenads on their hills that leapt","And yelled as beasts of ravin, and their meat","Was the rent flesh of their own sons to eat:","","And fiery shadows passing with strange cries,","And Sphinx-like shapes about the ruined lands,","And the red reek of parricidal hands","And intermixture of incestuous eyes,","And light as of that self-divided flame","Which made an end of the Cadmean name.","","And I beheld again, and lo the grave,","And the bright body laid therein as dead,","And the same shadow across another head","That bowed down silent on that sleeping slave","Who was the lady of empire from her birth","And light of all the kingdoms of the earth.","","Within the compass of the watcher's hand","All strengths of other men and divers powers","Were held at ease and gathered up as flowers;","His heart was as the heart of his whole land,","And at his feet as natural servants lay","Twilight and dawn and night and labouring day.","","He was most awful of the sons of God.","Even now men seeing seemed at his lips to see","The trumpet of the judgment that should be,","And in his right hand terror for a rod,","And in the breath that made the mountains bow","The horned fire of Moses on his brow.","","The strong wind of the coming of the Lord","Had blown as flame upon him, and brought down","On his bare head from heaven fire for a crown,","And fire was girt upon him as a sword","To smite and lighten, and on what ways he trod","There fell from him the shadow of a God.","","Pale, with the whole world's judgment in his eyes,","He stood and saw the grief and shame endure","That he, though highest of angels might not cure,","And the same sins done under the same skies,","And the same slaves to the same tyrants thrown,","And fain he would have slept, and fain been stone.","","But with unslumbering eyes he watched the sleep","That sealed her sense whose eyes were suns of old;","And the night shut and opened, and behold,","The same grave where those prophets came to weep,","But she that lay therein had moved and stirred,","And where those twain had watched her stood a third.","","The tripled rhyme that closed in Paradise","With Love's name sealing up its starry speech -","The tripled might of hand that found in reach","All crowns beheld far off of all men's eyes,","Song, colour, carven wonders of live stone -","These were not, but the very soul alone.","","The living spirit, the good gift of grace,","The faith which takes of its own blood to give","That the dead veins of buried hope may live,","Came on her sleeping, face to naked face,","And from a soul more sweet than all the south","Breathed love upon her sealed and breathless mouth.","","Between her lips the breath was blown as fire,","And through her flushed veins leapt the liquid life,","And with sore passion and ambiguous strife","The new birth rent her and the new desire,","The will to live, the competence to be,","The sense to hearken and the soul to see.","","And the third prophet standing by her grave","Stretched forth his hand and touched her, and her eyes","Opened as sudden suns in heaven might rise,","And her soul caught from his the faith to save;","Faith above creeds, faith beyond records, born","Of the pure, naked, fruitful, awful morn.","","For in the daybreak now that night was dead","The light, the shadow, the delight, the pain,","The purpose and the passion of those twain,","Seemed gathered on that third prophetic head,","And all their crowns were as one crown, and one","His face with her face in the living sun.","","For even with that communion of their eyes","His whole soul passed into her and made her strong;","And all the sounds and shows of shame and wrong,","The hand that slays, the lip that mocks and lies,","Temples and thrones that yet men seem to see -","Are these dead or art thou dead, Italy?"],"linecount":"386"},{"title":"Concord","author":"Algernon Charles Swinburne","lines":["Reconciled by death's mild hand, that

Pope","lines":["PART FIRST.","","'Tis hard to say, if greater want of skill","Appear in writing or in judging ill;","But, of the two, less dangerous is the offence","To tire our patience, than mislead our sense.","Some few in that, but numbers err in this;","Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss;","A fool might once himself alone expose,","Now one in verse makes many more in prose.","","'Tis with our judgments as our watches, none","Go just alike, yet each believes his own.","In poets as true genius is but rare,","True taste as seldom, is the critic's share;","Both must alike from Heaven derive their light,","These born to judge, as well as those to write.","Let such teach others who themselves excel.","And censure freely who have written well.","Authors are partial to their wit, 'tis true,","But are not critics to their judgment too?","","Yet if we look more closely, we shall find","Most have the seeds of judgment in their mind:","Nature affords at least a glimmering light;","The lines, though touch'd but faintly, are drawn right.","But as the slightest sketch, if justly traced,","Is by ill colouring but the more disgraced,","So by false learning is good sense defaced:","Some are bewilder'd in the maze of schools,","And some made coxcombs Nature meant but fools.","In search of wit these lose their common sense,","And then turn critics in their own defence:","Each burns alike, who can, or cannot write,","Or with a rival's, or an eunuch's spite.","All fools have still an itching to deride,","And fain would be upon the laughing side;","If Maevius scribble in Apollo's spite,","There are who judge still worse than he can write.","","Some have at first for wits, then poets pass'd,","Turn'd critics next, and proved plain fools at last.","Some neither can for wits nor critics pass,","As heavy mules are neither horse nor ass.","Those half-learn'd witlings, numerous in our isle,","As half-form'd insects on the banks of Nile;","Unfinished things, one knows not what to call,","Their generation's so equivocal:","To tell 'em would a hundred tongues require,","Or one vain wit's, that might a hundred tire.","","But you who seek to give and merit fame,","And justly bear a critic's noble name,","Be sure yourself and your own reach to know,","How far your genius, taste, and learning go;","Launch not beyond your depth, but be discreet,","And mark that point where sense and dulness meet.","","Nature to all things fix'd the limits fit,","And wisely curb'd proud man's pretending wit.","As on the land while here the ocean gains,","In other parts it leaves wide sandy plains;","Thus in the soul while memory prevails,","The solid power of understanding fails;","Where beams of warm imagination play,","The memory's soft figures melt away.","One science only will one genius fit,","So vast is art, so narrow human wit:","Not only bounded to peculiar arts,","But oft in those confined to single parts.","Like kings, we lose the conquests gain'd before,","By vain ambition still to make them more;","Each might his several province well command,","Would all but stoop to what they understand.","","First follow Nature, and your judgment frame","By her just standard, which is still the same:","Unerring Nature, still divinely bright,","One clear, unchanged, and universal light,","Life, force, and beauty, must to all impart,","At once the source, and end, and test of Art.","Art from that fund each just supply provides,","Works without show, and without pomp presides;","In some fair body thus the informing soul","With spirits feeds, with vigour fills the whole,","Each motion guides, and every nerve sustains,","Itself unseen, but in the effects, remains.","Some, to whom Heaven in wit has been profuse,","Want as much more to turn it to its use;","For wit and judgment often are at strife,","Though meant each other's aid, like man and wife,","'Tis more to guide than spur the Muse's steed,","Restrain his fury, than provoke his speed;","The wingèd courser, like a generous horse,","Shows most true mettle when you check his course.","","Those rules, of old discover'd, not devised,","Are Nature still, but Nature methodised;","Nature, like liberty, is but restrain'd","By the same laws which first herself ordain'd.","Hear how learn'd Greece her useful rules indites,","When to repress, and when indulge our flights:","High on Parnassus' top her sons she show'd,","And pointed out those arduous paths they trod;","Held from afar, aloft, the immortal prize,","And urged the rest by equal steps to rise.","Just precepts thus from great examples given,","She drew from them what they derived from Heaven.","The generous critic fann'd the poet's fire,","And taught the world with reason to admire.","Then Criticism the Muse's handmaid proved,","To dress her charms, and make her more beloved:","But following wits from that intention stray'd,","Who could not win the mistress, woo'd the maid;","Against the poets their own arms they turn'd,","Sure to hate most the men from whom they learn'd.","So modern 'pothecaries, taught the art,","By doctor's bills to play the doctor's part,","Bold in the practice of mistaken rules,","Prescribe, apply, and call their masters fools.","Some on the leaves of ancient authors prey,","Nor time nor moths e'er spoil'd so much as they.","Some drily plain, without invention's aid,","Write dull receipts how poems may be made.","These leave the sense, their learning to display,","And those explain the meaning quite away.","","You then, whose judgment the right course would steer,","Know well each ancient's proper character;","His fable, subject, scope in every page;","Religion, country, genius of his age;","Without all these at once before your eyes,","Cavil you may, but never criticise.","Be Homer's works your study and delight,","Read them by day, and meditate by night;","Thence form your judgment, thence your maxims bring,","And trace the Muses upward to their spring.","Still with itself compared, his text peruse;","And let your comment be the Mantuan Muse.","When first young Maro in his boundless mind,","A work t' outlast immortal Rome design'd,","Perhaps he seem'd above the critic's law,","And but from Nature's fountains scorn'd to draw:","But when t' examine every part he came,","Nature and Homer were, he found, the same.","Convinced, amazed, he checks the bold design,","And rules as strict his labour'd work confine,","As if the Stagyrite o'erlook'd each line.","Learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem;","To copy nature is to copy them.","Some beauties yet no precepts can declare,","For there's a happiness as well as care.","Music resembles poetry, in each","Are nameless graces which no methods teach,","And which a master-hand alone can reach.","If, where the rules not far enough extend,","(Since rules were made but to promote their end)","Some lucky license answer to the full","The intent proposed, that license is a rule;","Thus Pegasus, a nearer way to take,","May boldly deviate from the common track;","Great wits sometimes may gloriously offend,","And rise to faults true critics dare not mend,","From vulgar bounds with brave disorder part,","And snatch a grace beyond the reach of art,","Which, without passing through the judgment, gains","The heart, and all its end at once attains.","In prospects thus, some objects please our eyes,","Which out of nature's common order rise,","The shapeless rock, or hanging precipice.","But though the ancients thus their rules invade,","(As kings dispense with laws themselves have made)","Moderns, beware! or if you must offend","Against the precept, ne'er transgress its end;","Let it be seldom, and compell'd by need,","And have at least their precedent to plead.","The critic else proceeds without remorse,","Seizes your fame, and puts his laws in force.","","I know there are, to whose presumptuous thoughts,","Those freer beauties, even in them, seem faults.","Some figures monstrous and misshaped appear,","Consider'd singly, or beheld too near,","Which, but proportion'd to their light, or place,","Due distance reconciles to form and grace.","A prudent chief not always must display","His powers in equal ranks, and fair array,","But with the occasion and the place comply,","Conceal his force, nay, seem sometimes to fly.","Those oft are stratagems which errors seem,","Nor is it Homer nods, but we that dream.","","Still green with bays each ancient altar stands,","Above the reach of sacrilegious hands;","Secure from flames, from envy's fiercer rage,","Destructive war, and all-involving age.","See from each clime the learn'd their incense bring!","Hear in all tongues consenting paeans ring!","In praise so just let every voice be join'd,","And fill the general chorus of mankind.","Hail, Bards triumphant! born in happier days;","Immortal heirs of universal praise!","Whose honours with increase of ages grow,","As streams roll down, enlarging as they flow;","Nations unborn your mighty names shall sound,","And worlds applaud that must not yet be found!","Oh may some spark of your celestial fire,","The last, the meanest of your sons inspire,","(That on weak wings, from far, pursues your flights,","Glows while he reads, but trembles as he writes)","To teach vain wits a science little known,","T' admire superior sense, and doubt their own!","","PART SECOND.","","Of all the causes which conspire to blind","Man's erring judgment, and misguide the mind,","What the weak head with strongest bias rules,","Is PRIDE, the never-failing vice of fools.","Whatever Nature has in worth denied,","She gives in large recruits of needless pride;","For as in bodies, thus in souls, we find","What wants in blood and spirits,

day.","Trust not yourself; but your defects to know,","Make use of every friend--and every foe.","","A little learning is a dangerous thing;","Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring:","There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,","And drinking largely sobers us again.","Fired at first sight with what the Muse imparts,","In fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts,","While from the bounded level of our mind,","Short views we take, nor see the lengths behind;","But, more advanced, behold with strange surprise,","New distant scenes of endless science rise!","So, pleased at first the towering Alps we try,","Mount o'er the vales, and seem to tread the sky,","The eternal snows appear already past,","And the first clouds and mountains seem the last:","But, those attain'd, we tremble to survey","The growing labours of the lengthen'd way,","The increasing prospect tires our wandering eyes,","Hills peep o'er hills, and Alps on Alps arise!","","A perfect judge will read each work of wit","With the same spirit that its author writ:","Survey the WHOLE, nor seek slight faults to find","Where nature moves, and rapture warms the mind;","Nor lose, for that malignant dull delight,","The generous pleasure to be charm'd with wit.","But in such lays as neither ebb nor flow,","Correctly cold, and regularly low,","That, shunning faults, one quiet tenor keep,","We cannot blame indeed--but we may sleep.","In wit, as nature, what affects our hearts","Is not the exactness of peculiar parts;","'Tis not a lip, or eye, we beauty call,","But the joint force and full result of all.","Thus when we view some well-proportion'd dome,","(The world's just wonder, and even thine, O Rome!)","No single parts unequally surprise,","All comes united to th' admiring eyes;","No monstrous height, or breadth, or length appear;","The whole at once is bold, and regular.","","Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see,","Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er shall be.","In every work regard the writer's end,","Since none can compass more than they intend;","And if the means be just, the conduct true,","Applause, in spite of trivial faults, is due.","As men of breeding, sometimes men of wit,","To avoid great errors, must the less commit:","Neglect the rules each verbal critic lays,","For not to know some trifles is a praise.","Most critics, fond of some subservient art,","Still make the whole depend upon a part:","They talk of principles, but notions prize,","And all to one loved folly sacrifice.","","Once on a time, La Mancha's knight, they say,","A certain bard encountering on the way,","Discoursed in terms as just, with looks as sage,","As e'er could Dennis, of the Grecian stage;","Concluding all were desperate sots and fools,","Who durst depart from Aristotle's rules.","Our author, happy in a judge so nice,","Produced his play, and begg'd the knight's advice;","Made him observe the subject, and the plot,","The Manners, Passions, Unities; what not?","All which, exact to rule, were brought about,","Were but a combat in the lists left out.","'What! leave the combat out?' exclaims the knight.","'Yes, or we must renounce the Stagyrite.'","'Not so, by Heaven!' (he answers in a rage);","'Knights, squires, and steeds must enter on the stage.'","'So vast a throng the stage can ne'er contain.'","'Then build a new, or act it in a plain.'","","Thus critics, of less judgment than caprice,","Curious, not knowing, not exact but nice,","Form short ideas, and offend in arts","(As most in manners) by a love to parts.","","Some to conceit alone their taste confine,","And glittering thoughts struck out at every line;","Pleased with a work where nothing's just or fit;","One glaring chaos and wild heap of wit.","Poets, like painters, thus, unskill'd to trace","The naked nature and the living grace,","With gold and jewels cover every part,","And hide with ornaments their want of art.","True wit is nature to advantage dress'd;","What oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd;","Something, whose truth convinced at sight we find,","That gives us back the image of our mind.","As shades more sweetly recommend the light,","So modest plainness sets off sprightly wit.","For works may have more wit than does 'em good,","As bodies perish through excess of blood.","","Others for language all their care express,","And value books, as women men, for dress:","Their praise is still--'The style is excellent;'","The sense, they humbly take upon content.","Words are like leaves, and where they most abound,","Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found.","False eloquence, like the prismatic glass,","Its gaudy colours spreads on every place;","The face of Nature we no more survey,","All glares alike, without distinction gay;","But true expression, like the unchanging sun,","Clears, and improves whate'er it shines upon;","It gilds all objects, but it alters none.","Expression is the dress of thought, and still","Appears more decent, as more suitable;","A vile conceit in pompous words express'd,","Is like a clown in regal purple dress'd:","For different styles with different subjects sort,","As several garbs with country, town, and court.","Some by old words to fame have made pretence,","Ancients in phrase, mere moderns in their sense;","Such labour'd nothings, in so strange a style,","Amaze the unlearn'd, and make the learnèd smile.","Unlucky, as Fungoso in the play,","These sparks with awkward vanity display","What the fine gentleman wore yesterday;","And but so mimic ancient wits at best,","As apes our grandsires, in their doublets dress'd.","In words, as fashions, the same rule will hold;","Alike fantastic, if too new, or old:","Be not the first by whom the new are tried,","Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.","","But most by numbers judge a poet's song;","And smooth or rough, with them, is right or wrong:","In the bright Muse, though thousand charms conspire,","Her voice is all these tuneful fools admire;","Who haunt Parnassus but to please their ear,","Not mend their minds; as some to church repair,","Not for the doctrine, but the music there.","These equal syllables alone require,","Though oft the ear the open vowels tire;","While expletives their feeble aid do join,","And ten low words oft creep in one dull line:","While they ring round the same unvaried chimes,","With sure returns of still expected rhymes;","Where'er you find 'the cooling western breeze,'","In the next line, it 'whispers through the trees:'","If crystal streams 'with pleasing murmurs creep,'","The reader's threaten'd (not in vain) with 'sleep:'","Then, at the last and only couplet fraught","With some unmeaning thing they call a thought,","A needless Alexandrine ends the song","That, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along.","Leave such to tune their own dull rhymes, and know","What's roundly smooth, or languishingly slow;","And praise the easy vigour of a line,","Where Denham's strength, and Waller's sweetness join.","True ease in writing comes from art, not chance,","As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance.","'Tis not enough no harshness gives offence,","The sound must seem an echo to the sense;","Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows,","And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows:","But when loud surges lash the sounding shore,","The hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar.","When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,","The line too labours, and the words move slow;","Not so, when swift Camilla scours the plain,","Flies o'er the unbending corn, and skims along the main.","Hear how Timotheus' varied lays surprise,","And bid alternate passions fall and rise!","While, at each change, the son of Libyan Jove","Now burns with glory, and then melts with love;","Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow,","Now sighs steal out, and tears begin to flow:","Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found,","And the world's victor stood subdued by sound!","The power of music all our hearts allow,","And what Timotheus was, is Dryden now.","","Avoid extremes; and shun the fault of such","Who still are pleased, too little or too much.","At every trifle scorn to take offence:","That always shows great pride or little sense;","Those heads, as stomachs, are not sure the best","Which nauseate all, and nothing can digest.","Yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move,","For fools admire, but men of sense approve:","As things seem large which we through mists descry,","Dulness is ever apt to magnify.","","Some, foreign writers, some, our own despise;","The ancients only, or the moderns prize.","Thus wit, like faith, by each man is applied","To one small sect, and all are damn'd beside.","Meanly they seek the blessing to confine,","And force that sun but on a part to shine,","Which not alone the southern wit sublimes,","But ripens spirits in cold northern climes;","Which from the first has shone on ages past,","Enlights the present, and shall warm the last;","Though each may feel increases and decays,","And see now clearer and now darker days.","Regard not then if wit be old or new,","But blame the false, and value still the true.","","Some ne'er advance a judgment of their own,","But catch the spreading notion of the town;","They reason and conclude by precedent,","And own stale nonsense which they ne'er invent.","Some judge of authors' names, not works, and then","Nor praise nor blame the writings, but the men.","Of all this servile herd, the worst is he","That in proud dulness joins with quality;","A constant critic at the great man's board,","To fetch and carry nonsense for my lord.","What woful stuff this madrigal would be,","In some starved hackney sonnetteer, or me?","But let a lord once own the happy lines","How the wit brightens! how the style refines!","Before his sacred name flies every fault,","And each exalted stanza teems with thought!","","The vulgar thus through imitation err;","As oft the learn'd by being singular:","So much they scorn the crowd, that if the throng","By chance go right, they purposely go wrong:","So schismatics the plain believers quit,","And are but damn'd for having too much wit.","Some praise at morning what they blame at night,","But always think the last opinion right.","A Muse by these is like a mistress used,","This hour she's idolised, the next abused;","While their weak heads, like towns unfortified,","'Twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side.","Ask them the cause; they're wiser still, they say;","And still to-morrow's wiser than to-day.","We think our fathers fools, so wise we grow;","Our wiser sons, no doubt, will think us so.","Once school-divines this zealous isle o'erspread;","Who knew most sentences, was deepest read;","Faith, Gospel, all, seem'd made to be disputed,","And none had sense enough to be confuted:","Scotists and Thomists now in peace remain,","Amidst their kindred cobwebs in Duck-lane.","If Faith itself has different dresses worn,","What wonder modes in wit should take their turn?","Oft, leaving what is natural and fit,","The current folly proves the ready wit,","And authors think their reputation safe","Which lives as long as fools are pleased to laugh.","","Some valuing those of their own side or mind,","Still make themselves the measure of mankind:","Fondly we think we honour merit then,","When we but praise ourselves in other men.","Parties in wit attend on those of state,","And public faction doubles private hate.","Pride, malice, folly, against Dryden rose,","In various shapes of parsons, critics, beaux;","But sense survived, when merry jests were past;","For rising merit will buoy up at last.","Might he return, and bless once more our eyes,","New Blackmores and new Milbourns must arise:","Nay, should great Homer lift his awful head,","Zoilus again would start up from the dead.","Envy will Merit, as its shade, pursue,","But like a shadow, proves the substance true;","For envied wit, like Sol eclipsed, makes known","The opposing body's grossness, not its own.","When first that sun too powerful beams displays,","It draws up vapours which obscure its rays;","But even those clouds at last adorn its way,","Reflect new glories, and augment the day.","","Be thou the first true merit to befriend;","His praise is lost, who stays till all commend.","Short is the date, alas! of modern rhymes,","And 'tis but just to let them live betimes.","No longer now that golden age appears,","When patriarch-wits survived a thousand years:","Now length of fame (our second life) is lost,","And bare threescore is all even that can boast;","Our sons their fathers' failing language see,","And such as Chaucer is, shall Dryden be.","So when the faithful pencil has design'd","Some bright idea of the master's mind,","Where a new world leaps out at his command,","And ready Nature waits upon his hand;","When the ripe colours soften and unite,","And sweetly melt into just shade and light;","When mellowing years their full perfection give,","And each bold figure just begins to live,","The treacherous colours the fair art betray,","And all the bright creation fades away!","","Unhappy wit, like most mistaken things,","Atones not for that envy which it brings.","In youth alone its empty praise we boast,","But soon the short-lived vanity is lost:","Like some fair flower the early spring supplies,","That gaily blooms, but even in blooming dies.","What is this wit, which must our cares employ?","The owner's wife, that other men enjoy;","Then most our trouble still when most admired,","And still the more we give, the more required;","Whose fame with pains we guard, but lose with ease,","Sure some to vex, but never all to please;","'Tis what the vicious fear, the virtuous shun,","By fools 'tis hated, and by knaves undone!","","If wit so much from ignorance undergo,","Ah, let not learning too commence its foe!","Of old, those met rewards who could excel,","And such were praised who but endeavour'd well:","Though triumphs were to generals only due,","Crowns were reserved to grace the soldiers too.","Now, they who reach Parnassus' lofty crown,","Employ their pains to spurn some others down;","And while self-love each jealous writer rules,","Contending wits become the sport of fools:","But still the worst with most regret commend,","For each ill author is as bad a friend.","To what base ends, and by what abject ways,","Are mortals urged through sacred lust of praise!","Ah, ne'er so dire a thirst of glory boast,","Nor in the critic let the man be lost.","Good-nature and good-sense must ever join;","To err is human--to forgive, divine.","","But if in noble minds some dregs remain,","Not yet purged off, of spleen and sour disdain;","Discharge that rage on more provoking crimes,","Nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times.","No pardon vile obscenity should find,","Though wit and art conspire to move your mind;","But dulness with obscenity must prove","As shameful sure as impotence in love.","In the fat age of pleasure, wealth, and ease,","Sprung the rank weed, and thrived with large increase:","When love was all an easy monarch's care;","Seldom at council, never in a war:","Jilts ruled the state, and statesmen farces writ;","Nay, wits had pensions, and young lords had wit;","The fair sat panting at a courtier's play,","And not a mask went unimproved away:","The modest fan was lifted up no more,","And virgins smiled at what they blush'd before.","The following license of a foreign reign","Did all the dregs of bold Socinus drain;","Then unbelieving priests reform'd the nation,","And taught more pleasant methods of salvation;","Where Heaven's free subjects might their rights dispute,","Lest God himself should seem too absolute:","Pulpits their sacred satire learn'd to spare,","And vice admired to find a flatterer there!","Encouraged thus, wit's Titans braved the skies,","And the press groan'd with licensed blasphemies.","These monsters, critics! with your darts engage,","Here point your thunder, and exhaust your rage!","Yet shun their fault, who, scandalously nice,","Will needs mistake an author into vice;","All seems infected that the infected spy,","As all looks yellow to the jaundiced eye.","","PART THIRD.","","Learn, then, what MORALS critics ought to show,","For 'tis but half a judge's task to know.","'Tis not enough, taste, judgment, learning join;","In all you speak, let truth and candour shine:","That not alone what to your sense is due","All may allow; but seek your friendship too.","","Be silent always when you doubt your sense;","And speak, though sure, with seeming diffidence:","Some positive, persisting fops we know,","Who, if once wrong, will needs be always so;","But you, with pleasure own your errors past,","And make each day a critique on the last.","","'Tis not enough your counsel still be true;","Blunt truths more mischief than nice falsehoods do;","Men must be taught as if you taught them not,","And things unknown proposed as things forgot.","Without good-breeding, truth is disapproved;","That only makes superior sense beloved.","","Be niggards of advice on no pretence;","For the worst avarice is that of sense.","With mean complaisance ne'er betray your trust,","Nor be so civil as to prove unjust.","Fear not the anger of the wise to raise;","Those best can bear reproof, who merit praise.","","'Twere well might critics still this freedom take,","But Appius reddens at each word you speak,","And stares tremendous, with a threatening eye,","Like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry.","Fear most to tax an Honourable fool,","Whose right it is, uncensured, to be dull;","Such, without wit, are poets when they please,","As without learning they can take degrees.","Leave dangerous truths to unsuccessful satires,","And flattery to fulsome dedicators,","Whom, when they praise, the world believes no more,","Than when they promise to give scribbling o'er.","'Tis best sometimes your censure to restrain,","And charitably let the dull be vain:","Your silence there is better than your spite,","For who can rail so long as they can write?","Still humming on, their drowsy course they keep,","And lash'd so long, like tops, are lash'd asleep.","False steps but help them to renew the race,","As, after stumbling, jades will mend their pace.","What crowds of these, impenitently bold,","In sounds and jingling syllables grown old,","Still run on poets, in a raging vein,","Even to the dregs and squeezings of the brain,","Strain out the last dull droppings of their sense,","And rhyme with all the rage of impotence!","","Such shameless bards we have; and yet 'tis true,","There are as mad, abandon'd critics too.","The bookful blockhead, ignorantly read,","With loads of learnèd lumber in his head,","With his own tongue still edifies his ears,","And always listening to himself appears.","All books he reads, and all he reads assails,","From Dryden's Fables down to D'Urfey's Tales.","With him, most authors steal their works, or buy;","Garth did not write his own Dispensary.","Name a new play, and he's the poet's friend,","Nay, show'd his faults--but when would poets mend?","No place so sacred from such fops is barr'd,","Nor is Paul's church more safe than Paul's churchyard:","Nay, fly to altars; there they'll talk you dead:","For fools rush in where angels fear to tread.","Distrustful sense with modest caution speaks,","It still looks home, and short excursions makes;","But rattling nonsense in full volleys breaks,","And, never shock'd, and never turn'd aside,","Bursts out, resistless, with a thundering tide.","","But where's the man, who counsel can bestow,","Still pleased to teach, and yet not proud to know?","Unbiass'd, or by favour, or by spite;","Not dully prepossess'd, nor blindly right;","Though learn'd, well-bred; and though well-bred, sincere;","Modestly bold, and humanly severe:","Who to a friend his faults can freely show,","And gladly praise the merit of a foe?","Bless'd with a taste exact, yet unconfined;","A knowledge both of books and human kind;","Generous converse; a soul exempt from pride;","And love to praise, with reason on his side?","","Such once were critics; such the happy few,","Athens and Rome in better ages knew.","The mighty Stagyrite first left the shore,","Spread all his sails, and durst the deeps explore;","He steer'd securely, and discover'd far,","Led by the light of the Maeonian star.","Poets, a race long unconfined, and free,","Still fond and proud of savage liberty,","Received his laws; and stood convinced 'twas fit,","Who conquer'd Nature, should preside o'er Wit.","","Horace still charms with graceful negligence,","And without method talks us into sense,","Will, like a friend, familiarly convey","The truest notions in the easiest way.","He who, supreme in judgment, as in wit,","Might boldly censure, as he boldly writ,","Yet judged with coolness, though he sung with fire;","His precepts teach but what his works inspire.","Our critics take a contrary extreme,","They judge with fury, but they write with phlegm:","Nor suffers Horace more in wrong translations","By wits, than critics in as wrong quotations.","","See Dionysius Homer's thoughts refine,","And call new beauties forth from every line!","","Fancy and art in gay Petronius please,","The scholar's learning, with the courtier's ease.","","In grave Quintilian's copious work we find","The justest rules and clearest method join'd:","Thus useful arms in magazines we place,","All ranged in order, and disposed with grace,","But less to please the eye, than arm the hand,","Still fit for use, and ready at command.","","Thee, bold Longinus! all the Nine inspire,","And bless their critic with a poet's fire.","An ardent judge, who, zealous in his trust,","With warmth gives sentence, yet is always just;","Whose own example strengthens all his laws;","And is himself that Great Sublime he draws.","","Thus long succeeding critics justly reign'd,","Licence repress'd, and useful laws ordain'd.","Learning and Rome alike in empire grew;","And arts still follow'd where her eagles flew;","From the same foes, at last, both felt their doom,","And the same age saw Learning fall, and Rome.","With Tyranny then Superstition join'd,","As that the body, this enslaved the mind;","Much was believed, but little understood,","And to be dull was construed to be good;","A second deluge Learning thus o'errun,","And the Monks finish'd what the Goths begun.","","At length Erasmus, that great injured name,","(The glory of the priesthood, and the shame!)","Stemm'd the wild torrent of a barbarous age,","And drove those holy Vandals off the stage.","","But see! each Muse, in Leo's golden days,","Starts from her trance, and trims her wither'd bays,","Rome's ancient Genius, o'er its ruins spread,","Shakes off the dust, and rears his reverend head.","Then Sculpture and her sister-arts revive;","Stones leap'd to form, and rocks began to live;","With sweeter notes each rising temple rung:","A Raphael painted, and a Vida sung:","Immortal Vida! on whose honour'd brow","The poet's bays and critic's ivy grow;","Cremona now shall ever boast thy name,","As next in place to Mantua, next in fame!","","But soon by impious arms from Latium chased,","Their ancient bounds the banish'd Muses pass'd;","Thence Arts o'er all the northern world advance,","But critic-learning flourish'd most in France:","The rules a nation, born to serve, obeys;","And Boileau still in right of Horace sways.","But we, brave Britons, foreign laws despised,","And kept unconquer'd and uncivilised;","Fierce for the liberties of wit, and bold,","We still defied the Romans, as of old.","Yet some there were, among the sounder few","Of those who less presumed, and better knew,","Who durst assert the juster ancient cause,","And here restored Wit's fundamental laws.","Such was the Muse, whose rules and practice tell,","'Nature's chief masterpiece is writing well.'","Such was Roscommon, not more learn'd than good,","With manners generous as his noble blood;","To him the wit of Greece and Rome was known,","And every author's merit, but his own.","Such late was Walsh--the Muse's judge and friend,","Who justly knew to blame or to commend;","To failings mild, but zealous for desert;","The clearest head, and the sincerest heart.","This humble praise, lamented Shade! receive,","This praise at least a grateful Muse may give:","The Muse, whose early voice you taught to sing,","Prescribed her heights, and pruned her tender wing,","(Her guide now lost) no more attempts to rise,","But in low numbers short excursions tries:","Content, if hence the unlearn'd their wants may view,","The learn'd reflect on what before they knew:","Careless of censure, nor too fond of fame;","Still pleased to praise, yet not afraid to blame;","Averse alike to flatter, or offend;","Not free from faults, nor yet too vain to mend."],"linecount":"747"},{"title":"The Rape of the Lock:","author":"Alexander Pope","lines":["AN HEROI-COMICAL POEM.","","'Nolueram, Belinda, tuos violare capillos;","  Sed juvat, hoc precibus me

Caryll, Muse! is due:","This, even Belinda may vouchsafe to view:","Slight is the subject, but not so the praise,","If she inspire, and he approve my lays.","","Say what strange motive, Goddess! could compel","A well-bred lord t'assault a gentle belle?","Oh, say what stranger cause, yet unexplored,","Could make a gentle belle reject a lord?","In tasks so bold, can little men engage,","And in soft bosoms dwells such mighty rage?","","Sol through white curtains shot a timorous ray,","And oped those eyes that must eclipse the day:","Now lap-dogs give themselves the rousing shake,","And sleepless lovers, just at twelve, awake:","Thrice rung the bell, the slipper knock'd the ground,","And the press'd watch return'd a silver sound.","Belinda still her downy pillow press'd,","Her guardian Sylph prolong'd the balmy rest:","'Twas he had summon'd to her silent bed","The morning-dream that hover'd o'er her head,","A youth more glittering than a birth-night beau,","(That even in slumber caused her cheek to glow),","Seem'd to her ear his willing lips to lay,","And thus in whispers said, or seem'd to say:","","'Fairest of mortals, thou distinguish'd care","Of thousand bright inhabitants of air!","If e'er one vision touch thy infant thought,","Of all the nurse and all the priest have taught;","Of airy elves by moonlight shadows seen,","The silver token, and the circled green,","Or virgins visited by angel-powers,","With golden crowns and wreaths of heavenly flowers;","Hear and believe! thy own importance know,","Nor bound thy narrow views to things below.","Some secret truths, from learned pride conceal'd,","To maids alone and children are reveal'd:","What though no credit doubting wits may give?","The fair and innocent shall still believe.","Know then, unnumber'd spirits round thee fly,","The light militia of the lower sky:","These, though unseen, are ever on the wing,","Hang o'er the box, and hover round the ring.","Think what an equipage thou hast in air,","And view with scorn two pages and a chair.","As now your own, our beings were of old,","And once enclosed in woman's beauteous mould;","Thence, by a soft transition, we repair","From earthly vehicles to these of air.","Think not, when woman's transient breath is fled,","That all her vanities at once are dead;","Succeeding vanities she still regards,","And though she plays no more, o'erlooks the cards.","Her joy in gilded chariots, when alive,","And love of ombre, after death survive.","For when the fair in all their pride expire,","To their first elements their souls retire:","The sprites of fiery termagants in flame","Mount up, and take a Salamander's name.","Soft yielding minds to water glide away,","And sip, with Nymphs, their elemental tea.","The graver prude sinks downward to a Gnome,","In search of mischief still on earth to roam.","The light coquettes in Sylphs aloft repair,","And sport and flutter in the fields of air.","","'Know further yet; whoever fair and chaste","Rejects mankind, is by some Sylph embraced:","For spirits, freed from mortal laws, with ease","Assume what sexes and what shapes they please.","What guards the purity of melting maids,","In courtly balls, and midnight masquerades,","Safe from the treacherous friend, the daring spark,","The glance by day, the whisper in the dark,","When kind occasion prompts their warm desires,","When music softens, and when dancing fires?","'Tis but their Sylph, the wise celestials know,","Though honour is the word with men below.","","'Some nymphs there are, too conscious of their face,","For life predestined to the Gnomes' embrace.","These swell their prospects, and exalt their pride,","When offers are disdain'd, and love denied;","Then gay ideas crowd the vacant brain,","While peers, and dukes, and all their sweeping train,","And garters, stars, and coronets appear,","And in soft sounds, 'Your Grace' salutes their ear.","'Tis these that early taint the female soul,","Instruct the eyes of young coquettes to roll,","Teach infant cheeks a bidden blush to know,","And little hearts to flutter at a beau.","","'Oft, when the world imagine women stray,","The Sylphs through mystic mazes guide their way,","Through all the giddy circle they pursue,","And old impertinence expel by new.","What tender maid but must a victim fall","To one man's treat, but for another's ball?","When Florio speaks, what virgin could withstand,","If gentle Damon did not squeeze her hand?","With varying vanities, from every part,","They shift the moving toyshop of their heart,","Where wigs with wigs, with sword-knots sword-knots strive,","Beaux banish beaux, and coaches coaches drive.","This erring mortals levity may call,","Oh, blind to truth! the Sylphs contrive it all.","","'Of these am I, who thy protection claim,","A watchful sprite, and Ariel is my name.","Late, as I ranged the crystal wilds of air,","In the clear mirror of thy ruling star","I saw, alas! some dread event impend,","Ere to the main this morning sun descend,","But heaven reveals not what, or how, or where:","Warn'd by the Sylph, oh, pious maid, beware!","This to disclose is all thy guardian can:","Beware of all, but most beware of man!'","","He said; when Shock, who thought she slept too long,","Leap'd up, and waked his mistress with his tongue.","'Twas then, Belinda, if report say true,","Thy eyes first open'd on a

laid.","First, robed in white, the nymph intent adores,","With head uncover'd, the cosmetic powers.","A heavenly image in the glass appears,","To that she bends, to that her eyes she rears;","The inferior priestess, at her altar's side,","Trembling, begins the sacred rites of pride.","Unnumber'd treasures ope at once, and here","The various offerings of the world appear;","From each she nicely culls with curious toil,","And decks the goddess with the glittering spoil.","This casket India's glowing gems unlocks,","And all Arabia breathes from yonder box.","The tortoise here, and elephant unite,","Transform'd to combs, the speckled and the white.","Here files of pins extend their shining rows,","Puffs, powders, patches, Bibles, billet-doux.","Now awful beauty puts on all its arms;","The fair each moment rises in her charms,","Repairs her smiles, awakens every grace,","And calls forth all the wonders of her face;","Sees by degrees a purer blush arise,","And keener lightnings quicken in her eyes.","The busy Sylphs surround their darling care,","These set the head, and those divide the hair,","Some fold the sleeve, whilst others plait the gown:","And Betty's praised for labours not her own.","","CANTO II.","","Not with more glories, in the ethereal plain,","The sun first rises o'er the purpled main,","Than, issuing forth, the rival of his beams","Launched on the bosom of the silver Thames.","Fair nymphs and well-dress'd youths around her shone,","But every eye was fix'd on her alone.","On her white breast a sparkling cross she wore,","Which Jews might kiss, and infidels adore.","Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose,","Quick as her eyes, and as unfix'd as those:","Favours to none, to all she smiles extends;","Oft she rejects, but never once offends.","Bright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike,","And, like the sun, they shine on all alike.","Yet graceful ease, and sweetness void of pride","Might hide her faults, if belles had faults to hide:","If to her share some female errors fall,","Look on her face, and you'll forget 'em all.","","This nymph, to the destruction of mankind,","Nourish'd two locks, which graceful hung behind","In equal curls, and well conspired to deck","With shining ringlets the smooth ivory neck.","Love in these labyrinths his slaves detains,","And mighty hearts are held in slender chains.","With hairy springes we the birds betray,","Slight lines of hair surprise the finny prey,","Fair tresses man's imperial race ensnare,","And beauty draws us with a single hair.","","The adventurous Baron the bright locks admired;","He saw, he wished, and to the prize aspired.","Resolved to win, he meditates the way,","By force to ravish, or by fraud betray;","For when success a lover's toil attends,","Few ask if fraud or force attain'd his ends.","","For this, ere Phoebus rose, he had implored","Propitious Heaven, and every power adored,","But chiefly Love--to Love an altar built,","Of twelve vast French romances, neatly gilt.","There lay three garters, half a pair of gloves;","And all the trophies of his former loves;","With tender billet-doux he lights the pyre,","And breathes three amorous sighs to raise the fire.","Then prostrate falls, and begs with ardent eyes","Soon to obtain, and long possess the prize:","The powers gave ear, and granted half his prayer,","The rest, the winds dispersed in empty air.","","But now secure the painted vessel glides,","The sunbeams trembling on the floating tides:","While melting music steals upon the sky,","And soften'd sounds along the waters die;","Smooth flow the waves, the zephyrs gently play,","Belinda smiled, and all the world was gay.","All but the Sylph--with careful thoughts oppress'd,","The impending woe sat heavy on his breast.","He summons straight his denizens of air;","The lucid squadrons round the sails repair;","Soft o'er the shrouds aërial whispers breathe,","That seem'd but zephyrs to the train beneath.","Some to the sun their insect-wings unfold,","Waft on the breeze, or sink in clouds of gold;","Transparent forms, too fine for mortal sight,","Their fluid bodies half dissolved in light.","Loose to the wind their airy garments flew,","Thin glittering textures of the filmy dew,","Dipp'd in the richest tincture of the skies,","Where light disports in ever-mingling dyes;","While every beam new transient colours flings,","Colours that change whene'er they wave their wings.","Amid the circle, on the gilded mast,","Superior by the head, was Ariel placed;","His purple pinions opening to the sun,","He raised his azure wand, and thus begun:","","'Ye Sylphs and Sylphids, to your chief give ear,","Fays, fairies, genii, elves, and demons hear!","Ye know the spheres, and various tasks assign'd","By laws eternal to the aërial kind.","Some in the fields of purest ether play,","And bask and whiten in the blaze of day:","Some guide the course of wandering orbs on high,","Or roll the planets through the boundless sky:","Some, less refined, beneath the moon's pale light","Pursue the stars that shoot athwart the night,","Or suck the mists in grosser air below,","Or dip their pinions in the painted bow,","Or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main,","Or o'er the glebe distil the kindly rain.","Others on earth o'er human race preside,","Watch all their ways, and all their actions guide:","Of these the chief the care of nations own,","And guard with arms divine the British throne.","","'Our humbler province is to tend the fair,","Not a less pleasing, though less glorious care;","To save the powder from too rude a gale,","Nor let the imprison'd essences exhale;","To draw fresh colours from the vernal flowers;","To steal from rainbows, ere they drop in showers,","A brighter wash; to curl their waving hairs,","Assist their blushes, and inspire their airs;","Nay, oft, in dreams, invention we bestow,","To change a flounce, or add a furbelow.","","'This day, black omens threat the brightest fair","That e'er deserved a watchful spirit's care;","Some dire disaster, or by force, or flight;","But what, or where, the Fates have wrapt in night.","Whether the nymph shall break Diana's law,","Or some frail China jar receive a flaw;","Or stain her honour, or her new brocade;","Forget her prayers, or miss a masquerade;","Or lose her heart, or necklace, at a ball;","Or whether Heaven has doom'd that Shock must fall,","Haste then, ye spirits! to your charge repair:","The fluttering fan be Zephyretta's care;","The drops to thee, Brillante, we consign;","And, Momentilla, let the watch be thine;","Do thou, Crispissa, tend her favourite lock;","Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock.","","'To fifty chosen Sylphs, of special note,","We trust the important charge, the petticoat:","Oft have we known that sevenfold fence to fail,","Though stiff with hoops, and arm'd with ribs of whale;  120","Form a strong line about the silver bound,","And guard the wide circumference around.","","'Whatever spirit, careless of his charge,","His post neglects, or leaves the fair at large,","Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins,","Be stopp'd in vials, or transfix'd with pins;","Or plunged in lakes of bitter washes lie,","Or wedged whole ages in a bodkin's eye:","Gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain,","While, clogg'd, he beats his silken wings in vain;","Or alum styptics with contracting power","Shrink his thin essence like a rivell'd flower:","Or, as Ixion fix'd, the wretch shall feel","The giddy motion of the whirling mill,","In fumes of burning chocolate shall glow,","And tremble at the sea that froths below!'","","He spoke; the spirits from the sails descend;","Some, orb in orb, around the nymph extend;","Some thread the mazy ringlets of her hair;","Some hang upon the pendants of her ear;","With beating hearts the dire event they wait,","Anxious, and trembling for the birth of Fate.","","CANTO III.","","Close by those meads, for ever crown'd with flowers,","Where Thames with pride surveys his rising towers,","There stands a structure of majestic frame,","Which from the neighb'ring Hampton takes its name.","Here Britain's statesmen oft the fall foredoom","Of foreign tyrants, and of nymphs at home;","Here thou, great Anna! whom three realms obey,","Dost sometimes counsel take--and sometimes tea.","","Hither the heroes and the nymphs resort,","To taste awhile the pleasures of a court;","In various talk the instructive hours they pass'd,","Who gave the ball, or paid the visit last;","One speaks the glory of the British Queen,","And one describes a charming Indian screen;","A third interprets motions, looks, and eyes;","At every word a reputation dies.","Snuff, or the fan, supply each pause of chat,","With singing, laughing, ogling, and all that.","","Meanwhile, declining from the noon of day,","The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray;","The hungry judges soon the sentence sign,","And wretches hang that jurymen may dine;","The merchant from the Exchange returns in peace,","And the long labours of the toilet cease.","Belinda now, whom thirst of fame invites,","Burns to encounter two adventurous knights,","At ombre singly to decide their doom,","And swells her breast with conquests yet to come.","Straight the three bands prepare in arras to join,","Each band the number of the sacred Nine.","Soon as she spreads her hand, the aërial guard","Descend, and sit on each important card:","First Ariel perch'd upon a Matadore,","Then each, according to the rank they bore;","For Sylphs, yet mindful of their ancient race,","Are, as when women, wondrous fond of place.","","Behold, four Kings in majesty revered,","With hoary whiskers and a forky beard;","And four fair Queens, whose hands sustain a flower,","Th' expressive emblem of their softer power;","Four Knaves in garbs succinct, a trusty band,","Caps on their heads, and halberts in their hand;","And particolour'd troops, a shining train,","Draw forth to combat on the velvet plain.","","The skilful nymph reviews her force with care:","'Let Spades be Trumps!' she said, and Trumps they were.","","Now move to war her sable Matadores,","In show like leaders of the swarthy Moors.","Spadillio first, unconquerable lord!","Led off two captive Trumps, and swept the board.","As many more Manillio forced to yield,","And march'd a victor from the verdant field.","Him Basto follow'd, but his fate more hard","Gain'd but one Trump and one plebeian card.","With his broad sabre next, a chief in years,","The hoary Majesty of Spades appears,","Puts forth one manly leg, to sight reveal'd,","The rest, his many-colour'd robe conceal'd.","The rebel Knave, who dares his prince engage,","Proves the just victim of his royal rage.","Even mighty Pam, that Kings and Queens o'erthrew","And mow'd down armies in the fights of Loo,","Sad chance of war! now destitute of aid,","Falls undistinguish'd by the victor Spade!","","Thus far both armies to Belinda yield;","Now to the Baron fate inclines the field.","His warlike Amazon her host invades,","The imperial consort of the crown of Spades.","The Club's black tyrant first her victim died,","Spite of his haughty mien, and barbarous pride:","What boots the regal circle on his head,","His giant limbs in state unwieldy spread;","That long behind he trails his pompous robe,","And, of all monarchs, only grasps the globe?","","The Baron now his Diamonds pours apace;","The embroider'd King who shows but half his face,","And his refulgent Queen, with powers combined,","Of broken troops an easy conquest find.","Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, in wild disorder seen,","With throngs promiscuous strew the level green.","Thus when dispersed a routed army runs,","Of Asia's troops, and Afric's sable sons,","With like confusion different nations fly,","Of various habit and of various dye;","The pierced battalions disunited fall","In heaps on heaps; one fate o'erwhelms them all.","","The Knave of Diamonds tries his wily arts,","And wins (oh shameful chance!) the Queen of Hearts.","At this, the blood the virgin's cheek forsook,","A livid paleness spreads o'er all her look;","She sees, and trembles at the approaching ill,","Just in the jaws of ruin, and Codille.","And now, (as oft in some distemper'd state)","On one nice trick depends the general fate,","An Ace of Hearts steps forth: the King unseen","Lurk'd in her hand, and mourn'd his captive Queen:","He springs to vengeance with an eager pace,","And falls like thunder on the prostrate Ace.","The nymph, exulting, fills with shouts the sky;","The walls, the woods, and long canals reply.","","O thoughtless mortals! ever blind to fate,","Too soon dejected, and too soon elate.","Sudden these honours shall be snatch'd away,","And cursed for ever this victorious day.","","For lo! the board with cups and spoons is crown'd,","The berries crackle, and the mill turns round;","On shining altars of Japan they raise","The silver lamp; the fiery spirits blaze:","From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide,","While China's earth receives the smoking tide:","At once they gratify their scent and taste,","And frequent cups prolong the rich repast.","Straight hover round the fair her airy band;","Some, as she sipp'd, the fuming liquor fann'd,","Some o'er her lap their careful plumes display'd,","Trembling, and conscious of the rich brocade.","Coffee (which makes the politician wise,","And see through all things with his half-shut eyes)","Sent up in vapours to the Baron's brain","New stratagems, the radiant lock to gain.","Ah, cease, rash youth! desist ere 'tis too late,","Fear the just gods, and think of Scylla's fate!","Changed to a bird, and sent to flit in air,","She dearly pays for Nisus' injured hair!","","But when to mischief mortals bend their will,","How soon they find fit instruments of ill!","Just then, Clarissa drew with tempting grace","A two-edged weapon from her shining case:","So ladies in romance assist their knight,","Present the spear, and arm him for the fight,","He takes the gift with reverence, and extends","The little engine on his fingers' ends:","This just behind Belinda's neck he spread,","As o'er the fragrant steams she bends her head.","Swift to the lock a thousand sprites repair,","A thousand wings, by turns, blow back the hair;","And thrice they twitch'd the diamond in her ear;","Thrice she look'd back, and thrice the foe drew near.","Just in that instant, anxious Ariel sought","The close recesses of the virgin's thought;","As on the nosegay in her breast reclined,","He watch'd the ideas rising in her mind,","Sudden he view'd, in spite of all her art,","An earthly lover lurking at her heart.","Amazed, confused, he found his power expired,","Resign'd to fate, and with a sigh retired.","","The Peer now spreads the glittering forfex wide,","To inclose the lock; now joins it to divide.","Even then, before the fatal engine closed,","A wretched Sylph too fondly interposed;","Fate urged the shears, and cut the Sylph in twain,","(But airy substance soon unites again)","The meeting points the sacred hair dissever","From the fair head, for ever, and for ever!","","Then flash'd the living lightning from her eyes,","And screams of horror rend the affrighted skies.","Not louder shrieks to pitying heaven are cast,","When husbands, or when lapdogs breathe their last;","Or when rich China vessels, fallen from high,","In glittering dust and painted fragments lie!","","'Let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine,","(The victor cried) the glorious prize is mine!","While fish in streams, or birds delight in air,","Or in a coach-and-six the British fair,","As long as Atalantis shall be read,","Or the small pillow grace a lady's bed,","While visits shall be paid on solemn days,","When numerous wax-lights in bright order blaze,","While nymphs take treats, or assignations give,","So long my honour, name, and praise shall live!'","","What Time would spare, from steel receives its date,","And monuments, like men, submit to fate!","Steel could the labour of the gods destroy,","And strike to dust the imperial towers of Troy;","Steel could the works of mortal pride confound,","And hew triumphal arches to the ground.","What wonder then, fair nymph! thy hairs should feel,","The conquering force of unresisted steel?","","CANTO IV.","","But anxious cares the pensive nymph oppress'd,","And secret passions labour'd in her breast.","Not youthful kings in battle seized alive,","Not scornful virgins who their charms survive,","Not ardent lovers robb'd of all their bliss,","Not ancient ladies when refused a kiss,","Not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die,","Not Cynthia when her manteau's pinn'd awry,","E'er felt such rage, resentment, and despair,","As thou, sad virgin! for thy ravish'd hair.","","For, that sad moment, when the Sylphs withdrew,","And Ariel weeping from Belinda flew,","Umbriel, a dusky, melancholy sprite,","As ever sullied the fair face of light,","Down to the central earth, his proper scene,","Repair'd, to search the gloomy cave of Spleen.","","Swift on his sooty pinions flits the Gnome,","And in a vapour reach'd the dismal dome.","No cheerful breeze this sullen region knows,","The dreaded east is all the wind that blows;","Here in a grotto, shelter'd close from air,","And screened in shades from day's detested glare,","She sighs for ever on her pensive bed,","Pain at her side, and Megrim at her head.","","Two handmaids wait the throne: alike in place,","But differing far in figure and in face.","Here stood Ill-nature like an ancient maid,","Her wrinkled form in black and white array'd;","With store of prayers for mornings, nights, and noons","Her hand is fill'd; her bosom with lampoons.","","There Affectation, with a sickly mien,","Shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen;","Practised to lisp, and hang the head aside,","Faints into airs, and languishes with pride;","On the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe,","Wrapp'd in a gown, for sickness, and for show.","The fair ones feel such maladies as these,","When each new night-dress gives a new disease.","","A constant vapour o'er the palace flies,","Strange phantoms rising as the mists arise;","Dreadful, as hermits' dreams in haunted shades,","Or bright, as visions of expiring maids.","Now glaring fiends, and snakes on rolling spires,","Pale spectres, gaping tombs, and purple fires:","Now lakes of liquid gold, Elysian scenes,","And crystal domes, and angels in machines.","Unnumber'd throngs on every side are seen","Of bodies changed to various forms by Spleen.","Here living teapots stand, one arm held out,","One bent; the handle this, and that the spout:","A pipkin there, like Homer's tripod walks;","Here sighs a jar, and there a goose-pie talks;","Men prove with child, as powerful fancy works,","And maids turn'd bottles, call aloud for corks.","","Safe pass'd the Gnome through this fantastic band,","A branch of healing spleenwort in his hand.","Then thus address'd the power--'Hail, wayward Queen!","Who rule the sex to fifty from fifteen:","Parent of vapours and of female wit,","Who give the hysteric, or poetic fit,","On various tempers act by various ways,","Make some take physic, others scribble plays;","Who cause the proud their visits to delay,","And send the godly in a pet to pray;","A nymph there is, that all thy power disdains,","And thousands more in equal mirth maintains.","But oh! if e'er thy Gnome could spoil a grace,","Or raise a pimple on a beauteous face,","Like citron-waters matrons' cheeks inflame,","Or change complexions at a losing game;","If e'er with airy horns I planted heads,","Or rumpled petticoats, or tumbled beds,","Or caused suspicion when no soul was rude,","Or discomposed the head-dress of a prude,","Or e'er to costive lapdog gave disease,","Which not the tears of brightest eyes could ease:","Hear me, and touch Belinda with chagrin,","That single act gives half the world the spleen.'","","The goddess with a discontented air","Seems to reject him, though she grants his prayer.","A wondrous bag with both her hands she binds,","Like that where once Ulysses held the winds;","There she collects the force of female lungs,","Sighs, sobs, and passions, and the war of tongues.","A vial next she fills with fainting fears,","Soft sorrows, melting griefs, and flowing tears.","The Gnome rejoicing bears her gifts away,","Spreads his black wings, and slowly mounts to day.","","Sunk in Thalestris' arms the nymph he found,","Her eyes dejected and her hair unbound.","Full o'er their heads the swelling bag he rent,","And all the furies issued at the vent.","Belinda burns with more than mortal ire,","And fierce Thalestris fans the rising fire.","'O wretched maid!' she spread her hands, and cried,","(While Hampton's echoes 'wretched maid!' replied)","'Was it for this you took such constant care","The bodkin, comb, and essence to prepare?","For this your locks in paper durance bound,","For this with torturing irons wreath'd around?","For this with fillets strain'd your tender head,","And bravely bore the double loads of lead?","Gods! shall the ravisher display your hair,","While the fops envy, and the ladies stare?","Honour forbid! at whose unrivall'd shrine","Ease, pleasure, virtue, all our sex resign.","Methinks already I your tears survey,","Already hear the horrid things they say,","Already see you a degraded toast,","And all your honour in a whisper lost!","How shall I, then, your helpless fame defend?","'Twill then be infamy to seem your friend!","And shall this prize, the inestimable prize,","Exposed through crystal to the gazing eyes,","And heighten'd by the diamond's circling rays,","On that rapacious hand for ever blaze?","Sooner shall grass in Hyde-park Circus grow,","And wits take lodgings in the sound of Bow;","Sooner let earth, air, sea to chaos fall,","Men, monkeys, lapdogs, parrots, perish all!'","","She said; then raging to Sir Plume repairs,","And bids her beau demand the precious hairs:","(Sir Plume of amber snuff-box justly vain,","And the nice conduct of a clouded cane.)","With earnest eyes, and round, unthinking face,","He first the snuff-box open'd, then the case,","And thus broke out--'My Lord, why, what the devil?","Z--ds! damn the lock! 'fore Gad, you must be civil!","Plague on't! 'tis past a jest--nay, prithee, pox!","Give her the hair'--he spoke, and rapp'd his box.","","'It grieves me much' (replied the Peer again)","Who speaks so well should ever speak in vain;","'But by this lock, this sacred lock I swear,","(Which never more shall join its parted hair;","Which never more its honours shall renew,","Clipp'd from the lovely head where late it grew)","That while my nostrils draw the vital air,","This hand, which won it, shall for ever wear.'","He spoke, and, speaking, in proud triumph spread","The long-contended honours of her head.","","But Umbriel, hateful Gnome! forbears not so;","He breaks the vial whence the sorrows flow.","Then see! the nymph in beauteous grief appears,","Her eyes half-languishing, half-drown'd in tears;","On her heaved bosom hung her drooping head,","Which, with a sigh, she raised; and thus she said:","","'For ever cursed be this detested day,","Which snatch'd my best, my favourite curl away!","Happy! ah, ten times happy had I been,","If Hampton Court these eyes had never seen!","Yet am not I the first mistaken maid,","By love of courts to numerous ills betray'd.","Oh, had I rather unadmired remain'd","In some lone isle, or distant northern land;","Where the gilt chariot never marks the way,","Where none learn ombre, none e'er taste bohea!","There kept my charms conceal'd from mortal eye,","Like roses that in deserts bloom and die.","What moved my mind with youthful lords to roam?","Oh, had I stay'd, and said my prayers at home!","'Twas this the morning omens seem'd to tell:","Thrice from my trembling hand the patch-box fell;","The tottering china shook without a wind,","Nay, Poll sat mute, and Shock was most unkind!","A Sylph too warn'd me of the threats of Fate,","In mystic visions, now believed too late.","See the poor remnants of these slighted hairs!","My hands shall rend what ev'n thy rapine spares:","These in two sable ringlets taught to break,","Once gave new beauties to the snowy neck;","The sister-lock now sits uncouth, alone,","And in its fellow's fate foresees its own;","Uncurl'd it hangs, the fatal shears demands,","And tempts, once more, thy sacrilegious hands.","Oh hadst thou, cruel! been content to seize","Hairs less in sight, or any hairs but these!'","","CANTO V.","","She said: the pitying audience melt in tears;","But Fate and Jove had stopp'd the Baron's ears.","In vain Thalestris with reproach assails,","For who can move when fair Belinda fails?","Not half so fix'd the Trojan could remain,","While Anna begg'd and Dido raged in vain.","Then grave Clarissa graceful waved her fan;","Silence ensued, and thus the nymph began:","","'Say, why are beauties praised and honour'd most,","The wise man's passion, and the vain man's toast?","Why deck'd with all that land and sea afford?","Why angels call'd, and angel-like adored?","Why round our coaches crowd the white-gloved beaux?","Why bows the side-box from its inmost rows?","How vain are all these glories, all our pains,","Unless good sense preserve what beauty gains:","That men may say, when we the front-box grace,","Behold the first in virtue as in face!","Oh! if to dance all night, and dress all day,","Charm'd the small-pox, or chased old-age away;","Who would not scorn what housewife's cares produce,","Or who would learn one earthly thing of use?","To patch, nay ogle, might become a saint,","Nor could it, sure, be such a sin to paint.","But since, alas! frail beauty must decay,","Curl'd or uncurl'd, since locks will turn to gray;","Since painted, or not painted, all shall fade,","And she who scorns a man, must die a maid;","What then remains, but well our power to use,","And keep good-humour still, whate'er we lose?","And trust me, dear! good-humour can prevail,","When airs, and flights, and screams, and scolding fail.","Beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll;","Charms strike the sight, but merit wins the soul.'","","So spoke the dame, but no applause ensued;","Belinda frown'd, Thalestris call'd her prude.","'To arms, to arms!' the fierce virago cries,","And swift as lightning to the combat flies.","All side in parties, and begin the attack;","Fans clap, silks rustle, and tough whalebones crack;","Heroes' and heroines' shouts confusedly rise,","And bass and treble voices strike the skies.","No common weapons in their hands are found,","Like gods they fight, nor dread a mortal wound.","","So when bold Homer makes the gods engage,","And heavenly breasts with human passions rage;","'Gainst Pallas, Mars; Latona, Hermes arms,","And all Olympus rings with loud alarms:","Jove's thunder roars, heaven trembles all around,","Blue Neptune storms, the bellowing deeps resound:","Earth shakes her nodding towers, the ground gives way,","And the pale ghosts start at the flash of day!","","Triumphant Umbriel on a sconce's height","Clapp'd his glad wings, and sat to view the fight;","Propp'd on their bodkin spears, the sprites survey","The growing combat, or assist the fray.","","While through the press enraged Thalestris flies,","And scatters death around from both her eyes,","A beau and witling perish'd in the throng,","One died in metaphor, and one in song.","'O cruel nymph! a living death I bear,'","Cried Dapperwit, and sunk beside his chair.","A mournful glance Sir Fopling upwards cast,","'Those eyes are made so killing!'--was his last.","Thus on Maeander's flowery margin lies","The expiring swan, and as he sings he dies.","","When bold Sir Plume had drawn Clarissa down,","Chloe stepped in, and kill'd him with a frown;","She smiled to see the doughty hero slain,","But, at her smile, the beau revived again.","","Now Jove suspends his golden scales in air,","Weighs the men's wits against the lady's hair;","The doubtful beam long nods from side to side;","At length the wits mount up, the hairs subside.","","See fierce Belinda on the Baron flies,","With more than usual lightning in her eyes:","Nor fear'd the chief th' unequal fight to try,","Who sought no more than on his foe to die.","But this bold lord, with manly strength endued,","She with one finger and a thumb subdued:","Just where the breath of life his nostrils drew,","A charge of snuff the wily virgin threw;","The Gnomes direct, to every atom just,","The pungent grains of titillating dust.","Sudden, with starting tears each eye o'erflows,","And the high dome re-echoes to his nose.","'Now meet thy fate!' incensed Belinda cried,","And drew a deadly bodkin from her side,","(The same, his ancient personage to deck,","Her great-great-grandsire wore about his neck,","In three seal-rings; which after, melted down,","Form'd a vast buckle for his widow's gown:","Her infant grandame's whistle next it grew,","The bells she jingled, and the whistle blew;","Then in a bodkin graced her mother's hairs,","Which long she wore, and now Belinda wears.)","'Boast not my fall,' (he cried) 'insulting foe!","Thou by some other shalt be laid as low.","Nor think, to die dejects my lofty mind:","All that I dread is leaving you behind!","Rather than so, ah! let me still survive,","And burn in Cupid's flames,--but burn alive.'","","'Restore the lock!' she cries; and all around","'Restore the lock!' the vaulted roofs rebound.","Not fierce Othello in so loud a strain","Roar'd for the handkerchief that caused his pain.","But see how oft ambitious aims are cross'd,","And chiefs contend till all the prize is lost!","The lock, obtain'd with guilt, and kept with pain,","In every place is sought, but sought in vain:","With such a prize no mortal must be blest,","So Heaven decrees!

house midway hanging see","That saw Saint Catherine bodily,","Felt on its floors her sweet feet move,","And the live light of fiery love","Burn from her beautiful strange face,","As in the sanguine sacred place","Where in pure hands she took the head","Severed, and with pure lips still red","Kissed the lips dead.","","For years through, sweetest of the saints,","In quiet without cease she wrought,","Till cries of men and fierce complaints","From outward moved her maiden thought;","And prayers she heard and sighs toward France,","\"God, send us back deliverance,","Send back thy servant, lest we die!\"","With an exceeding bitter cry","They smote the sky.","","Then in her sacred saving hands","She took the sorrows of the lands,","With maiden palms she lifted up","The sick time's blood-embittered cup,","And in her virgin garment furled","The faint limbs of a wounded world.","Clothed with calm love and clear desire,","She went forth in her soul's attire,","A missive fire.","","Across the might of men that strove","It shone, and over heads of kings;","And molten in red flames of love","Were swords and many monstrous things;","And shields were lowered, and snapt were spears,","And sweeter-tuned the clamorous years;","And faith came back, and peace, that were","Fled; for she bade, saying, \"Thou, God's heir,","Hast thou no care?","","\"Lo, men lay waste thine heritage","Still, and much heathen people rage","Against thee, and devise vain things.","What comfort in the face of kings,","What counsel is there? Turn thine eyes","And thine heart from them in like wise;","Turn thee unto thine holy place","To help us that of God for grace","Require thy face.","","\"For who shall hear us if not thou","In a strange land? what doest thou there?","Thy sheep are spoiled, and the ploughers plough","Upon us; why hast thou no care","For all this, and beyond strange hills","Liest unregardful what snow chills","Thy foldless flock, or what rains beat?","Lo, in thine ears, before thy feet,","Thy lost sheep bleat.","","\"And strange men feed on faultless lives,","And there is blood, and men put knives,","Shepherd, unto the young lamb's throat;","And one hath eaten, and one smote,","And one had hunger and is fed","Full of the flesh of these, and red","With blood of these as who drinks wine","And God knoweth, who hath sent thee a sign,","If these were thine.\"","","But the Pope's heart within him burned,","So that he rose up, seeing the sign,","And came among them; but she turned","Back to her daily way divine,","And fed her faith with silent things,","And lived her life with curbed white wings,","And mixed herself with heaven and died:","And now on the sheer city-side","Smiles like a bride.","","You see her in the fresh clear gloom,","Where walls shut out the flame and bloom","Of full-breathed summer, and the roof","Keeps the keen ardent air aloof","And sweet weight of the violent sky:","There bodily beheld on high,","She seems as one hearing in tune","Heaven within heaven, at heaven's full noon,","In sacred swoon:","","A solemn swoon of sense that aches","With imminent blind heat of heaven,","While all the wide-eyed spirit wakes,","Vigilant of the supreme Seven,","Whose choral flames in God's sight move,","Made unendurable with love,","That without wind or blast of breath","Compels all things through life and death","Whither God saith.","","There on the dim side-chapel wall","Thy mighty touch memorial,","Razzi, raised up, for ages dead,","And fixed for us her heavenly head:","And, rent with plaited thorn and rod,","Bared the live likeness of her God","To men's eyes turning from strange lands,","Where, pale from thine immortal hands,","Christ wounded stands;","","And the blood blots his holy hair","And white brows over hungering eyes","That plead against us, and the fair","Mute lips forlorn of words or sighs","In the great torment that bends down","His bruised head with the bloomless crown,","White as the unfruitful thorn-flower,","A God beheld in dreams that were","Beheld of her.","","In vain on all these sins and years","Falls the sad blood, fall the slow tears;","In vain poured forth as watersprings,","Priests, on your altars, and ye, kings,","About your seats of sanguine gold;","Still your God, spat upon and sold,","Bleeds at your hands; but now is gone","All his flock from him saving one;","Judas alone.","","Surely your race it was that he,","O men signed backward with his name,","Beholding in Gethsemane","Bled the red bitter sweat of shame,","Knowing how the word of Christian should","Mean to men evil and not good,","Seem to men shameful for your sake,","Whose lips, for all the prayers they make,","Man's blood must slake.","","But blood nor tears ye love not, you","That my love leads my longing to,","Fair as the world's old faith of flowers,","O golden goddesses of ours!","From what Idalian rose-pleasance","Hath Aphrodite bidden glance","The lovelier lightnings of your feet?","From what sweet Paphian sward or seat","Led you more sweet?","","O white three sisters, three as

no Greek worships her shrined limbs","With wreaths and Cytherean hymns?","Where no lute makes luxurious","The adoring airs in Amathus,","Till the maid, knowing her mother near,","Sobs with love, aching with sweet fear?","What do ye here?","","For the outer land is sad, and wears","A raiment of a flaming fire;","And the fierce fruitless mountain stairs","Climb, yet seem wroth and loth to aspire,","Climb, and break, and are broken down,","And through their clefts and crests the town","Looks west and sees the dead sun lie,","In sanguine death that stains the sky","With angry dye.","","And from the war-worn wastes without","In twilight, in the time of doubt,","One sound comes of one whisper, where","Moved with low motions of slow air","The great trees nigh the castle swing","In the sad coloured evening;","\"Ricorditi di me, che son","La Pia\"--that small sweet word alone","Is not yet gone.","","\"Ricorditi di me\"--the sound","Sole out of deep dumb days remote","Across the fiery and fatal ground","Comes tender as a hurt bird's note","To where, a ghost with empty hands,","A woe-worn ghost, her palace stands","In the mid city, where the strong","Bells turn the sunset air to song,","And the towers throng.","","With other face, with speech the same,","A mightier maiden's likeness came","Late among mourning men that slept,","A sacred ghost that went

the shore and loves the wind that leaves them free,","Strange as sleep and pale as death and fair as life,","Shifts the moonlight-coloured sunshine on the sea.","","Toward the sunset's goal the

ember","From forth a flameless pile:","But golden-girt November","Bids all she looks on smile.","","The lustrous foliage, waning","As wanes the morning moon,","Here falling, here refraining,","Outbraves the pride of June","With statelier semblance, feigning","No fear lest death be soon:","As though the woods thus waning","Should wax to meet the moon.","","As though, when fields lie stricken","By grey December's breath,","These lordlier growths that sicken","And die for fear of death","Should feel the sense requicken","That hears what springtide saith","And thrills for love, spring-stricken","And pierced with April's breath.","","The keen white-winged north-easter","That stings and spurs thy sea","Doth yet but feed and feast her","With glowing sense of glee:","Calm chained her, storm released her,","And storm's glad voice was he:","South-wester or north-easter,","Thy winds rejoice the sea.","","V","A dream, a dream is it all -- the season,","The sky, the water, the wind, the shore?","A day-born dream of divine unreason,","A marvel moulded of sleep -- no more?","For the cloudlike wave that my limbs while cleaving","Feel as in slumber beneath them heaving","Soothes the sense as to slumber, leaving","Sense of nought that was known of yore.","","A purer passion, a lordlier leisure,","A peace more happy than lives on land,","Fulfils with pulse of diviner pleasure","The dreaming head and the steering hand.","I lean my cheek to the cold grey pillow,","The deep soft swell of the full broad billow,","And close mine eyes for delight past measure,","And wish the wheel of the world would stand.","","The wild-winged hour that we fain would capture","Falls as from heaven that its light feet clomb,","So brief, so soft, and so full the rapture","Was felt that soothed me with sense of home.","To sleep, to swim, and to dream, for ever --","Such joy the vision of man saw never;","For here too soon will a dark day sever","The sea-bird's wing from the sea-wave's foam.","","A dream, and more than a dream, and dimmer","At once and brighter than dreams that flee,","The moment's joy of the seaward swimmer","Abides, remembered as truth may be.","Not all the joy and not all the glory","Must fade as leaves when the woods wax hoary;","For there the downs and the sea-banks glimmer,","And here to south of them swells the sea."],"linecount":"128"},{"title":"The Last Oracle","author":"Algernon Charles Swinburne","lines":["eipate toi basilei, xamai pese daidalos aula.","ouketi PHoibos exei kaluban, ou mantida

chord, of faith as of a lyre;","One heat, of hope as of a fire;","One heart, one music, and one might,","One flame, one altar, and one choir;","And one man's living head in sight","Who said, when all time's sea was foam,","\"Let there be Rome\"--and there was Rome.","","As a star set in space for token","Like a live word of God's mouth spoken,","Visible sound, light audible,","In the great darkness thick as hell","A stanchless flame of love unsloken,","A sign to conquer and compel,","A law to stand in heaven unbroken","Whereby the sun shines, and wherethrough","Time's eldest empires are made new;","","So rose up on our generations","That light of the most ancient nations,","Law, life, and light, on the world's way,","The very God of very day,","The sun-god; from their star-like stations","Far down the night in disarray","Fled, crowned with fires of tribulations,","The suns of sunless years, whose light","And life and law were of the night.","","The naked kingdoms quenched and stark","Drave with their dead things down the dark,","Helmless; their whole world, throne by throne,","Fell, and its whole heart turned to stone,","Hopeless; their hands that touched our ark","Withered; and lo, aloft, alone,","On time's white waters man's one bark,","Where the red sundawn's open eye","Lit the soft gulf of low green sky.","","So for a season piloted","It sailed the sunlight, and struck red","With fire of dawn reverberate","The wan face of incumbent fate","That paused half pitying overhead","And almost had foregone the freight","Of those dark hours the next day bred","For shame, and almost had forsworn","Service of night for love of morn.","","Then broke the whole night in one blow,","Thundering; then all hell with one throe","Heaved, and brought forth beneath the stroke","Death; and all dead things moved and woke","That the dawn's arrows had brought low,","At the great sound of night that broke","Thundering, and all the old world-wide woe;","And under night's loud-sounding dome","Men sought her, and she was not Rome.","","Still with blind hands and robes blood-wet","Night hangs on heaven, reluctant yet,","With black blood dripping from her eyes","On the soiled lintels of the skies,","With brows and lips that thirst and threat,","Heart-sick with fear lest the sun rise,","And aching with her fires that set,","And shuddering ere dawn bursts her bars,","Burns out with all her beaten stars.","","In this black wind of war they fly","Now, ere that hour be in the sky","That brings back hope, and memory back,","And light and law to lands that lack;","That spiritual sweet hour whereby","The bloody-handed night and black","Shall be cast out of heaven to die;","Kingdom by kingdom, crown by crown,","The fires of darkness are blown down.","","Yet heavy, grievous yet the weight","Sits on us of imperfect fate.","From wounds of other days and deeds","Still this day's breathing body bleeds;","Still kings for fear and slaves for hate","Sow lives of men on earth like seeds","In the red soil they saturate;","And we, with faces eastward set,","Stand sightless of the morning yet.","","And many for pure sorrow's sake","Look back and stretch back hands to take","Gifts of night's giving, ease and sleep,","Flowers of night's grafting, strong to steep","The soul in dreams it will not break,","Songs of soft hours that sigh and sweep","Its lifted eyelids nigh to wake","With subtle plumes and lulling breath","That soothe its weariness to death.","","And many, called of hope and pride,","Fall ere the sunrise from our side.","Fresh lights and rumours of fresh fames","That shift and veer by night like flames,","Shouts and blown trumpets, ghosts that glide","Calling, and hail them by dead names,","Fears, angers, memories, dreams divide","Spirit from spirit, and wear out","Strong hearts of men with hope and doubt.","","Till time beget and sorrow bear","The soul-sick eyeless child despair,","That comes among us, mad and blind,","With counsels of a broken mind,","Tales of times dead and woes that were,","And, prophesying against mankind,","Shakes out the horror of her hair","To take the sunlight with its coils","And hold the living soul in toils.","","By many ways of death and moods","Souls pass into their servitudes.","Their young wings weaken, plume by plume","Drops, and their eyelids gather gloom","And close against man's frauds and feuds,","And their tongues call they know not whom","To help in their vicissitudes;","For many slaveries are, but one","Liberty, single as the sun.","","One light, one law, that burns up strife,","And one sufficiency of life.","Self-stablished, the sufficing soul","Hears the loud wheels of changes roll,","Sees against man man bare the knife,","Sees the world severed, and is whole;","Sees force take dowerless fraud to wife,","And fear from fraud's incestuous bed","Crawl forth and smite his father dead:","","Sees death made drunk with war, sees time","Weave many-coloured crime with crime,","State overthrown on ruining state,","And dares not be disconsolate.","Only the soul hath feet to climb,","Only the soul hath room to wait,","Hath brows and eyes to hold sublime","Above all evil and all good,","All strength and all decrepitude.","","She only, she since earth began,","The many-minded soul of man,","From one incognizable root","That bears such divers-coloured fruit,","Hath ruled for blessing or for ban","The flight of seasons and pursuit;","She regent, she republican,","With wide and equal eyes and wings","Broods on things born and dying things.","","Even now for love or doubt of us","The hour intense and hazardous","Hangs high with pinions vibrating","Whereto the light and darkness cling,","Dividing the dim season thus,","And shakes from one ambiguous wing","Shadow, and one is luminous,","And day falls from it; so the past","Torments the future to the last.","","And we that cannot hear or see","The sounds and lights of liberty,","The witness of the naked God","That treads on burning hours unshod","With instant feet unwounded; we","That can trace only where he trod","By fire in heaven or storm at sea,","Not know the very present whole","And naked nature of the soul;","","We that see wars and woes and kings,","And portents of enormous things,","Empires, and agonies, and slaves,","And whole flame of town-swallowing graves;","That hear the harsh hours clap sharp wings","Above the roar of ranks like waves,","From wreck to wreck as the world swings;","Know but that men there are who see","And hear things other far than we.","","By the light sitting on their brows,","The fire wherewith their presence glows,","The music falling with their feet,","The sweet sense of a spirit sweet","That with their speech or motion grows","And breathes and burns men's hearts with heat;","By these signs there is none but knows","Men who have life and grace to give,","Men who have seen the soul and live.","","By the strength sleeping in their eyes,","The lips whereon their sorrow lies","Smiling, the lines of tears unshed,","The large divine look of one dead","That speaks out of the breathless skies","In silence, when the light is shed","Upon man's soul of memories;","The supreme look that sets love free,","The look of stars and of the sea;","","By the strong patient godhead seen","Implicit in their mortal mien,","The conscience of a God held still","And thunders ruled by their own will","And fast-bound fires that might burn clean","This worldly air that foul things fill,","And the afterglow of what has been,","That, passing, shows us without word","What they have seen, what they have heard,","","By all these keen and burning signs","The spirit knows them and divines.","In bonds, in banishment, in grief,","Scoffed at and scourged with unbelief,","Foiled with false trusts and thwart designs,","Stripped of green days and hopes in leaf,","Their mere bare body of glory shines","Higher, and man gazing surelier sees","What light, what comfort is of these.","","So I now gazing; till the sense","Being set on fire of confidence","Strains itself sunward, feels out far","Beyond the bright and morning star,","Beyond the extreme wave's refluence,","To where the fierce first sunbeams are","Whose fire intolerant and intense","As birthpangs whence day burns to be","Parts breathless heaven from breathing sea.","","I see not, know not, and am blest,","Master, who know that thou knowest,","Dear lord and leader, at whose hand","The first days and the last days stand,","With scars and crowns on head and breast,","That fought for love of the sweet land","Or shall fight in her latter quest;","All the days armed and girt and crowned","Whose glories ring thy glory round.","","Thou sawest, when all the world was blind,","The light that should be of mankind,","The very day that was to be;","And how shalt thou not sometime see","Thy city perfect to thy mind","Stand face to living face with thee,","And no miscrowned man's head behind;","The hearth of man, the human home,","The central flame that shall be Rome?","","As one that ere a June day rise","Makes seaward for the dawn, and tries","The water with delighted limbs","That taste the sweet dark sea, and swims","Right eastward under strengthening skies,","And sees the gradual rippling rims","Of waves whence day breaks blossom-wise","Take fire ere light peer well above,","And laughs from all his heart with love;","","And softlier swimming with raised head","Feels the full flower of morning shed","And fluent sunrise round him rolled","That laps and laves his body bold","With fluctuant heaven in water's stead,","And urgent through the growing gold","Strikes, and sees all the spray flash red,","And his soul takes the sun, and yearns","For joy wherewith the sea's heart burns;","","So the soul seeking through the dark","Heavenward, a dove without an ark,","Transcends the unnavigable sea","Of years that wear out memory;","So calls, a sunward-singing lark,","In the ear of souls that should be free;","So points them toward the sun for mark","Who steer not for the stress of waves,","And seek strange helmsmen, and are slaves.","","For if the swimmer's eastward eye","Must see no sunrise--must put by","The hope that lifted him and led","Once, to have light about his head,","To see beneath the clear low sky","The green foam-whitened wave wax red","And all the morning's banner fly -","Then, as earth's helpless hopes go down,","Let earth's self in the dark tides drown.","","Yea, if no morning must behold","Man, other than were they now cold,","And other deeds than past deeds done,","Nor any near or far-off sun","Salute him risen and sunlike-souled,","Free,

hearts going back to thee, they were filled with fire,","Were nigh to break.","","It was said to us: \"Verily ye are great of heart,","But ye shall bend;","Ye are bondmen and bondwomen, to be scourged and smart,","To toil and tend.\"","","And with harrows men harrowed us, and subdued with spears,","And crushed with shame;","And the summer and winter was, and the length of years,","And no change came.","","By the rivers of Italy, by the sacred streams,","By town, by tower,","There was feasting with revelling, there was sleep with dreams,","Until thine hour.","","And they slept and they rioted on their rose-hung beds,","With mouths on flame,","And with love-locks vine-chapleted, and with rose-crowned heads","And robes of shame.","","And they knew not their forefathers, nor the hills and streams","And words of power,","Nor the gods that were good to them, but with songs and dreams","Filled up their hour.","","By the rivers of Italy, by the dry streams' beds,","When thy time came,","There was casting of crowns from them, from their young men's heads,","The crowns of shame.","","By the horn of Eridanus, by the Tiber mouth,","As thy day rose,","They arose up and girded them to the north and south,","By seas, by snows.","","As a water in January the frost confines,","Thy kings bound thee;","As a water in April is, in the new-blown vines,","Thy sons made free.","","And thy lovers that looked for thee, and that mourned from far,","For thy sake dead,","We rejoiced in the light of thee, in the signal star","Above thine head.","","In thy grief had we followed thee, in thy passion loved,","Loved in thy loss;","In thy shame we stood fast to thee, with thy pangs were moved,","Clung to thy cross.","","By the hillside of Calvary we beheld thy blood,","Thy bloodred tears,","As a mother's in bitterness, an unebbing flood,","Years upon years.","","And the north was Gethsemane, without leaf or bloom,","A garden sealed;","And the south was Aceldama, for a sanguine fume","Hid all the field.","","By the stone of the sepulchre we returned to weep,","From far, from prison;","And the guards by it keeping it we beheld asleep,","But thou wast risen.","","And an angel's similitude by the unsealed grave,","And by the stone:","And the voice was angelical, to whose words God gave","Strength like his own.","","\"Lo, the graveclothes of Italy that are folded up","In the grave's gloom!","And the guards as men wrought upon with a charmed cup,","By the open tomb.","","\"And her body most beautiful, and her shining head,","These are not here;","For your mother, for Italy, is not surely dead:","Have ye no fear.","","\"As of old time she spake to you, and you hardly heard,","Hardly took heed,","So now also she saith to you, yet another word,","Who is risen indeed.","","\"By my saying she saith to you, in your ears she saith,","Who hear these things,","Put no trust in men's royalties, nor in great men's breath,","Nor words of kings.","","\"For the life of them vanishes and is no more seen,","Nor no more known;","Nor shall any remember him if a crown hath been,","Or where a throne.","","\"Unto each man his handiwork, unto each his crown,","The just Fate gives;","Whoso takes the world's life on him and his own lays down,","He, dying so, lives.","","\"Whoso bears the whole heaviness of the wronged world's weight","And puts it by,","It is well with him suffering, though he face man's fate;","How should he die?","","\"Seeing death has no part in him any more, no power","Upon his head;","He has bought his eternity with a little hour,","And is not dead.","","\"For an hour, if ye look for him, he is no more found,","For one hour's space;","Then ye lift up your eyes to him and behold him crowned,","A deathless face.","","\"On the mountains of memory, by the world's wellsprings,","In all men's eyes,","Where the light of the life of him is on all past things,","Death only dies.","","\"Not the light that was quenched for us, nor the deeds that were,","Nor the ancient days,","Nor the sorrows not sorrowful, nor the face most fair","Of perfect praise.\"","","So the angel of Italy's resurrection said,","So yet he saith;","So the son of her suffering, that from breasts nigh dead","Drew life, not death.","","That the pavement of Golgotha should be white as snow,","Not red, but white;","That the waters of Babylon should no longer

most they fear esteem,","Death when more horrid so more noble deem;","And blame the last Act, like Spectators vain,","Unless the Prince whom they applaud be slain.","Nor Fate indeed can well refuse that right","To those that liv'd in War, to dye in Fight.","But long his Valour none had left that could","Indanger him, or Clemency that would.","And he whom Nature all for Peace had made,","But angry Heaven unto War had sway'd,","And so less useful where he most desir'd,","For what he least affected was admir'd,","Deserved yet an End whose ev'ry part","Should speak the wondrous softness of his Heart.","To Love and Grief the fatal Writ was sign'd;","(Those nobler weaknesses of humane Mind,","From which those Powers that issu'd the Decree,","Although immortal, found they were not free.)","That they, to whom his Breast still open lyes,","In gentle Passions should his Death disguise:","And leave succeeding Ages cause to mourn,","As long as Grief shall weep, or Love shall burn.","Streight does a slow and languishing Disease","Eliza, Natures and his darling, seize.","Her when an infant, taken with her Charms,","He oft would flourish in his mighty Arms;","And, lest their force the tender burthen wrong,","Slacken the vigour of his Muscles strong;","Then to the Mothers brest her softly move,","Which while she drain'd of Milk she fill'd with Love:","But as with riper Years her Virtue grew,","And ev'ry minute adds a Lustre new;","When with meridian height her Beauty shin'd,","And thorough that sparkled her fairer Mind;","When She with Smiles serene and Words discreet","His hidden Soul at ev'ry turn could meet;","Then might y' ha' daily his Affection spy'd,","Doubling that knot which Destiny had ty'd:","While they by sence, not knowing, comprehend","How on each other both their Fates depend.","With her each day the pleasing Hours he shares,","And at her Aspect calms her growing Cares;","Or with a Grandsire's joy her Children sees","Hanging about her neck or at his knees.","Hold fast dear Infants, hold them both or none;","This will not stay when once the other's gone.","A silent fire now wasts those Limbs of Wax,","And him with his tortur'd Image racks.","So the Flowr with'ring which the Garden crown'd,","The sad Root pines in secret under ground.","Each Groan he doubled and each Sigh he sigh'd,","Repeated over to the restless Night.","No trembling String compos'd to numbers new,","Answers the touch in Notes more sad more true.","She lest He grieve hides what She can her pains,","And He to lessen hers his Sorrow feigns:","Yet both perceiv'd, yet both conceal'd their Skills,","And so diminishing increast their ills:","That whether by each others grief they fell,","Or on their own redoubled, none can tell.","And now Eliza's purple Locks were shorn,","Where she so long her Fathers fate had worn:","And frequent lightning to her Soul that flyes,","Devides the Air, and opens all the Skyes:","And now his Life, suspended by her breath,","Ran out impetuously to hasting Death.","Like polish'd Mirrours, so his steely Brest","Had ev'ry figure of her woes exprest;","And with the damp of her last Gasps obscur'd,","Had drawn

life","Chance to be prun'd by an untimely knife,","The Parent-Tree unto the Grief succeeds,","And through the Wound its vital humour bleeds;","Trickling in watry drops, whose flowing shape","Weeps that it falls ere fix'd into a Grape.","So the dry Stock, no more that spreading Vine,","Frustrates the Autumn and the hopes of Wine.","A secret Cause does sure those Signs ordain","Fore boding Princes falls, and seldom vain.","Whether some Kinder Pow'rs, that wish us well,","What they above cannot prevent, foretell;","Or the great World do by consent presage,","As hollow Seas with future Tempests rage:","Or rather Heav'n, which us so long fore sees,","Their fun'rals celebrate while it decrees.","But never yet was any humane Fate","By nature solemniz'd with so much state.","He unconcern'd the dreadful passage crost;","But oh what pangs that Death did Nature cost!","First the great Thunder was shot off, and sent","The Signal from the starry Battlement.","The Winds receive it, and its force out-do,","As practising how they could thunder too:","Out of the Binders Hand the Sheaves they tore,","And thrash'd the Harvest in the airy floore;","Or of huge Trees, whose growth with his did rise,","The deep foundations open'd to the Skyes.","Then heavy Showres the winged Tempests dead,","And pour the Deluge ore the Chaos head.","The Race of warlike Horses at his Tomb","Offer themselves in many an Hecatomb;","With pensive head towards the ground they fall,","And helpless languish at the tainted Stall.","Numbers of Men decrease with pains unknown,","And hasten not to see his Death their own.","Such Tortures all the Elements unfix'd,","Troubled to part where so exactly mix'd.","And as through Air his wasting Spirits flow'd,","The Universe labour'd beneath their load.","Nature it seem'd with him would Nature vye;","He with Eliza, It with him would dye.","He without noise still travell'd to his End,","As silent Suns to meet the Night descend.","The Stars that for him fought had only pow'r","Left to determine now his fatal Hour,","Which, since they might not hinder, yet they cast","To chuse it worthy of his Glories past.","No part of time but bore his mark away","Of honour; all the Year was Cromwell's day","But this, of all the most auspicious found,","Twice had in open field him Victor crown'd","When up the armed Mountains of Dunbar","He march'd, and

teach, but traffique with, or burn the Jew.","Unhappy Princes, ignorantly bred,","By Malice some, by Errour more misled;","If gracious Heaven to my Life give length,","Leisure to Times, and to my Weakness Strength,","Then shall I once with graver Accents shake","Your Regal sloth, and your long Slumbers wake:","Like the shrill Huntsman that prevents the East,","Winding his Horn to Kings that chase the Beast.","Till then my Muse shall hollow far behind","Angelique Cromwell who outwings the wind;","And in dark Nights, and in cold Dayes alone","Pursues the Monster thorough every Throne:","Which shrinking to her Roman Den impure,","Gnashes her Goary teeth; nor there secure.","Hence oft I think, if in some happy Hour","High Grace should meet in one with highest Pow'r,","And then a seasonable People still","Should bend to his, as he to Heavens will,","What we might hope, what wonderful Effect","From such a wish'd Conjuncture might reflect.","Sure, the mysterious Work, where none withstand,","Would forthwith finish under such a Hand:","Fore-shortned Time its useless Course would stay,","And soon precipitate the latest Day.","But a thick Cloud about that Morning lyes,","And intercepts the Beams of Mortal eyes,","That 'tis the most which we deteremine can,","If these the Times, then this must be the Man.","And well he therefore does, and well has guest,","Who in his Age has always forward prest:","And knowing not where Heavens choice may light,","Girds yet his Sword, and ready stands to fight;","But Men alas, as if they nothing car'd,","Look on, all unconcern'd, or unprepar'd;","And Stars still fall, and still the Dragons Tail","Swinges the Volumes of its horrid Flail.","For the great Justice that did first suspend","The World by Sin, does by the same extend.","Hence that blest Day still counterpoysed wastes,","The ill delaying, what th'Elected hastes;","Hence landing Nature to new Seas it tost,","And good Designes still with their Authors lost.","And thou, great Cromwell, for whose happy birth","A Mold was chosen out of better Earth;","Whose Saint-like Mother we did lately see","Live out an Age, long as a Pedigree;","That she might seem, could we the Fall dispute,","T'have smelt the Blossome, and not eat the Fruit;","Though none does of more lasting Parents grow,","But never any did them Honor so;","Though thou thine Heart from Evil still unstain'd,","And always hast thy Tongue from fraud refrain'd,","Thou, who so oft through Storms of thundring Lead","Hast born securely thine undaunted Head,","Thy Brest through ponyarding Conspiracies,","Drawn from the Sheath of lying Prophecies;","Thee proof beyond all other Force or Skill,","Our Sins endanger, and shall one day kill.","How near they fail'd, and in thy sudden Fall","At once assay'd to overturn us all.","Our brutish fury strugling to be Free,","Hurry'd thy Horses while they hurry'd thee.","When thou hadst almost quit thy Mortal cares,","And soyl'd in Dust thy Crown of silver Hairs.","Let this one Sorrow interweave among","The other Glories of our yearly Song.","Like skilful Looms which through the costly threed","Of purling Ore, a shining wave do shed:","So shall the Tears we on past Grief employ,","Still as they trickle, glitter in our Joy.","So with more Modesty we may be True,","And speak as of the Dead the Praises due:","While impious Men deceiv'd with pleasure short,","On their own Hopes shall find the Fall retort.","But the poor Beasts wanting their noble Guide,","What could they move? shrunk guiltily aside.","First winged Fear transports them far away,","And leaden Sorrow then their flight did stay.","See how they each his towring Crest abate,","And the green Grass, and their known Mangers hate,","Nor through wide Nostrils snuffe the wanton air,","Nor their round Hoofs, or curled Mane'scompare;","With wandring Eyes, and restless Ears theystood,","And with shrill Neighings ask'd him of the Wood.","Thou Cromwell falling, not a stupid Tree,","Or Rock so savage, but it mourn'd for thee:","And all about was heard a Panique groan,","As if that Natures self were overthrown.","It seem'd the Earth did from the Center tear;","It seem'd the Sun was faln out of the Sphere:","Justice obstructed lay, and Reason fool'd;","Courage disheartned, and Religion cool'd.","A dismal Silence through the Palace went,","And then loud Shreeks the vaulted Marbles rent.","Such as the dying Chorus sings by turns,","And to deaf Seas, and ruthless Tempests mourns,","When now they sink, and now the plundring Streams","Break up each Deck, and rip the Oaken seams.","But thee triumphant hence the firy Carr,","And firy Steeds had born out of the Warr,","From the low World, and thankless Men above,","Unto the Kingdom blest of Peace and Love:","We only mourn'd our selves, in thine Ascent,","Whom thou hadst lest beneath with Mantle rent.","For all delight of Life thou then didst lose,","When to Command, thou didst thy self Depose;","Resigning up thy Privacy so dear,","To turn the headstrong Peoples Charioteer;","For to be Cromwell was a greater thing,","Then ought below, or yet above a King:","Therefore thou rather didst thy Self depress,","Yielding to Rule, because it made thee Less.","For, neither didst thou from the first apply","Thy sober Spirit unto things too High,","But in thine own Fields exercisedst long,","An Healthful Mind within a Body strong;","Till at the Seventh time thou in the Skyes,","As a small Cloud, like a Mans hand didst rise;","Then did thick Mists and Winds the air deform,","And down at last thou pow'rdst the fertile Storm;","Which to the thirsty Land did plenty bring,","But though forewarn'd, o'r-took and wet the King.","What since he did, an higher Force him push'd","Still from behind, and it before him rush'd,","Though undiscern'd among the tumult blind,","Who think those high Decrees by Man design'd.","'Twas Heav'n would not that his Pow'r should cease,","But walk still middle betwixt War and Peace;","Choosing each Stone, and poysing every weight,","Trying the Measures of the Bredth and Height;","Here pulling down, and there erecting New,","Founding a firm State by Proportions true.","When Gideon so did from the War retreat,","Yet by Conquest of two Kings grown great,","He on the Peace extends a Warlike power,","And Is'rel silent saw him rase the Tow'r;","And how he Succoths Elders durst suppress,","With Thorns and Briars of the Wilderness.","No King might ever such a Force have done;","Yet would not he be Lord, nor yet his Son.","Thou with the same strength, and an Heart as plain,","Didst (like thine Olive) still refuse to Reign;","Though why should others all thy Labor spoil,","And Brambles be anointed with thine Oyl,","Whose climbing Flame, without a timely stop,","Had quickly Levell'd every Cedar's top.","Therefore first growing to thy self a Law,","Th'ambitious Shrubs thou in just time didst aw.","So have I seen at Sea, when whirling Winds,","Hurry the Bark, but more the Seamens minds,","Who with mistaken Course salute the Sand,","And threat'ning Rocks misapprehend for Land;","While baleful Tritons to the shipwrack guide.","And Corposants along the Tacklings slide.","The Passengers all wearyed out before,","Giddy, and wishing for the fatal Shore;","Some lusty Mate, who with more careful Eye","Counted the Hours, and ev'ry Star did spy,","The Helm does from the artless Steersman strain,","And doubles back unto the safer Main.","What though a while they grumble discontent,","Saving himself he does their loss prevent.","'Tis not a Freedome, that where All command;","Nor Tyranny, where One does them withstand:","But who of both the Bounders knows to lay","Him as their Father must the State obey.","Thou, and thine House, like Noah's Eight did rest,","Left by the Wars Flood on the Mountains crest:","And the large Vale lay subject to thy Will,","Which thou but as an Husbandman would Till:","And only didst for others plant the Vine","Of Liberty, not drunken with its Wine.","That sober Liberty which men may have,","That they enjoy, but more they vainly crave:","And such as to their Parents Tents do press,","May shew their own, not see his Nakedness.","Yet such a Chammish issue still does rage,","The Shame and Plague both of the Land and Age,","Who watch'd thy halting, and thy Fall deride,","Rejoycing when thy Foot had slipt aside;","that their new King might the fifth Scepter shake,","And make the World, by his Example, Quake:","Whose frantique Army should they want for Men","Might muster Heresies, so one were ten.","What thy Misfortune, they the Spirit call,","And their Religion only is to Fall.","Oh Mahomet! now couldst thou rise again,","Thy Falling-sickness should have made thee Reign,","While Feake and Simpson would in many a Tome,","Have writ the Comments of thy sacred Foame:","For soon thou mightst have past among their Rant","Wer't but for thine unmoved Tulipant;","As thou must needs have own'd them of thy band","For prophecies fit to be Alcorand.","Accursed Locusts, whom your King does spit","Out of the Center of th'unbottom'd Pit;","Wand'rers, Adult'rers, Lyers, Munser's rest,","Sorcerers, Atheists, Jesuites, Possest;","You who the Scriptures and the Laws deface","With the same liberty as Points and Lace;","Oh Race most hypocritically strict!","Bent to reduce us to the ancient Pict;","Well may you act the Adam and the Eve;","Ay, and the Serpent too that did deceive.","But the great Captain, now the danger's ore,","Makes you for his sake Tremble one fit more;","And, to your spight, returning yet alive","Does with himself all that is good revive.","So when first Man did through the Morning new","See the bright Sun his shining Race pursue,","All day he follow'd with unwearied sight,","Pleas'd with that other World of moving Light;","But thought him when he miss'd his setting beams,","Sunk in the Hills, or plung'd below the Streams.","While dismal blacks hung round the Universe,","And Stars (like Tapers) burn'd upon his Herse:","And Owls and Ravens with their screeching noyse","Did make the Fun'rals sadder by their Joyes.","His weeping Eyes the doleful Vigils keep,","Not knowing yet the Night was made for sleep:","Still to the West, where he him lost, he turn'd,","And with such accents, as Despairing, mourn'd:","Why did mine Eyes once see so bright a Ray;","Or why Day last no longer than a Day?","When streight the Sun behind him he descry'd,","Smiling serenely from the further side.","So while our Star that gives us Light and Heat,","Seem'd now a long and gloomy Night to threat,","Up from the other World his Flame he darts,","And Princes shining through their windows starts;","Who their suspected Counsellors refuse,","And credulous Ambassadors accuse.","\"Is this, saith one, the Nation that we read","\"Spent with both Wars, under a Captain dead?","\"Yet rig a Navy while we dress us late;","\"And ere we Dine, rase and rebuild our State.","\"What Oaken Forrests, and what golden Mines!","\"What Mints of Men, what Union of Designes!","\"Unless their Ships, do, as their Fowle proceed","\"Of shedding Leaves, that with their Ocean breed.","\"Theirs are not Ships, but rather Arks of War,","\"And beaked Promontories sail'd from far;","\"Of floting Islands a new Hatched Nest;","\"A Fleet of Worlds, of other Worlds in quest;","\"An hideous shole of wood Leviathans,","\"Arm'd with three Tire of brazen Hurricans;","\"That through the Center shoot their thundring side","\"And sink the Earth that does at Anchor ride.","'What refuge to escape them can be found,","\"Whose watry Leaguers all the world surround?","\"Needs must we all their Tributaries be,","\"Whose Navies hold the Sluces of the Sea.","\"The Ocean is the Fountain of Command,","\"But that once took, we Captives are on Land:","\"And those that have the Waters for their share,","\"Can quickly leave

Men, all Navies, and all Arms.","\"Him, all the Day, Him, in late Nights I dread,","\"And still his Sword seems hanging o're my head.","\"The Nation had been ours, but his one Soul","\"Moves the great Bulk, and animates the whole.","\"He Secrecy with Number hath inchas'd,","\"Courage with Age, Maturity with Hast:","\"The Valiants Terror, Riddle of the Wise;","\"And still his Fauchion all our Knots

vigour runs,","(Sun-like) the stages of succeeding suns:","And still the day which he doth next restore,","Is the just wonder of the day before.","Cromwell alone doth with new lustre spring,","And shines the jewel of the yearly ring.","","'Tis he the force of scattered time contracts,","And in one year the work of ages acts:","While heavy monarchs make a wide return,","Longer, and more malignant than Saturn:","And though they all Platonic years should reign,","In the same posture would be found again.","Their earthy projects under ground they lay,","More slow and brittle than the China clay:","Well may they strive to leave them to their son,","For one thing never was by one king done.","Yet some more active for a frontier town,","Taken by proxy, beg a false renown;","Another triumphs at the public cost,","And will have won, if he no more have lost;","They fight by others, but in person wrong,","And only are against their subjects strong;","Their other wars seem but a

bell,","Nor more contribute to the state of things,","Than wooden heads unto the viol's strings.","","While indefatigable Cromwell hies,","And cuts his way still nearer to the skies,","Learning a music in the region clear,","To tune this lower to that higher sphere.","","So when Amphion did the lute command,","Which the god gave him, with his gentle hand,","The rougher stones, unto his measures hewed,","Danced up in order from the quarries rude;","This took a lower, that an higher place,","As he the treble altered, or the bass:","No note he struck, but a new stone was laid,","And the great work ascended while he played.","","The listening structures he with wonder eyed,","And still new stops to various time applied:","Now through the strings a martial rage he throws,","And joining straight the Theban tower arose;","Then as he strokes them with a touch more sweet,","The flocking marbles in a palace meet;","But for the most the graver notes did try,","Therefore the temples reared their columns high:","Thus, ere he ceased, his sacred lute creates","Th' harmonious city of the seven gates.","","Such was that wondrous order and consent,","When Cromwell tuned the ruling Instrument,","While tedious statesmen many years did hack,","Framing a liberty that still went back,","Whose numerous gorge could swallow in an hour","That island, which the sea cannot devour:","Then our Amphion issued out and sings,","And once he struck, and twice, the powerful strings.","","The Commonwealth then first together came,","And each one entered in the willing frame;","All other matter yields, and may be ruled;","But who the minds of stubborn men can build?","No quarry bears a stone so hardly wrought,","Nor with such labour from its centre brought;","None

part,","Fastening the contignation which they thwart;","And they, whose nature leads them to divide,","Uphold this one, and that the other side;","But the most equal still sustain the height,","And they as pillars keep the work upright,","While the resistance of opposиd minds,","The fabric (as with arches) stronger binds,","Which on the basis of a senate free,","Knit by the roof's protecting

in his age has always forward pressed:","And knowing not where heaven's choice may light,","Girds yet his sword, and ready stand to fight;","But men, alas, as if they nothing cared,","Look on, all unconcerned, or unprepared;","And stars still fall, and still the dragon's tail","Swinges the volumes of its horrid flail.","For the great justice that did first suspend","The world by sin, does by the same extend.","Hence that blest day still counterposиd wastes,","The ill delaying what the elected hastes;","Hence landing nature to new seas is tossed,","And good designs still with their authors lost.","","And thou, great Cromwell, for whose happy birth","A mould was chosen out of better earth;","Whose saint-like mother we did lately see","Live out an age, long as a pedigree;","That she might seem (could we the Fall dispute),","T' have smelled the blossom, and not eat the fruit;","Though none does of more lasting parents grow,","Yet never any did them honour so,","Though thou thine heart from evil still unstained,","And always hast thy tongue from fraud refrained;","Thou, who so oft through storms of thundering lead","Hast born securely thine undaunted head,","Thy breast through poniarding conspiracies,","Drawn from the sheath of lying prophecies;","Thee proof behond all other force or skill,","Our sins endanger, and shall one day kill.","","How near they failed, and in thy sudden fall","At once assayed to overturn us all.","Our brutish fury struggling to be free,","Hurried thy horses while they hurried thee,","When thou hadst almost quit thy mortal cares,","And soiled in dust thy crown of silver hairs.","","Let this one sorrow interweave among","The other glories of our yearly song.","Like skilful looms, which through the costly thread","Of purling ore, a shining wave do shed:","So shall the tears we on past grief employ,","Still as they trickle, glitter in our joy.","So with more modesty we may be true,","And speak, as of the dead, the praises due:","While impious men deceived with pleasure short,","On their own hopes shall find the fall retort.","","But the poor beasts, wanting their noble guide,","(What could they more?) shrunk guiltily aside.","First wingиd fear transports them far away,","And leaden sorrow then their flight did stay.","See how they each his towering crest abate,","And the green grass, and their known mangers hate,","Nor through wide nostrils snuff the wanton air,","Nor their round hoofs, or curlиd manes compare;","With wandering eyes, and restless ears they stood,","And with shrill neighings asked him of the wood.","","Thou, Cromwell, falling, not a stupid tree,","Or rock so savage, but it mourned for thee:","And all about was heard a panic groan,","As if that Nature's self were overthrown.","It seemed the earth did from the centre tear;","It seemed the sun was fall'n out of the sphere:","Justice obstructed lay, and reason fooled;","Courage disheartened, and religion cooled.","A dismal silence through the palace went,","And then loud shrieks the vaulted marbles rent,","Such as the dying chorus sings by turns,","And to deaf seas, and ruthless tempests mourns,","When now they sink, and now the plundering streams","Break up each deck, and rip the oaken seams.","","But thee triumphant hence the fiery car,","And fiery steeds had borne out of the war,","From the low world, and thankless men above,","Unto the kingdom blest of peace and love:","We only mourned ourselves, in thine ascent,","Whom thou hadst left beneath with mantle rent.","","For all delight of life thou then didst lose,","When to command, thou didst thyself dispose;","Resigning up thy privacy so dear,","To turn the headstrong people's charioteer;","For to be Cromwell was a greater thing,","Then ought below, or yet above a king:","Therefore thou rather didst thyself depress,","Yielding to rule, because it made thee less.","","For neither didst thou from the first apply","Thy sober spirit unto things too high,","But in thine own fields exercised'st long,","An healthful mind within a body strong;","Till at the seventh time thou in the skies,","As a small cloud, like a man's hand, didst rise;","Then did thick mists and winds the air deform,","And down at last thou poured'st the fertile storm,","Which to the thirsty land did plenty bring,","But, though forewarned, o'ertook and wet the King.","","What since he did, an higher force him pushed","Still from behind, and yet before him rushed,","Though undiscerned among the tumult blind,","Who think those high decrees by man designed.","'Twas heaven would not that his power should cease,","But walk still middle betwixt war and peace:","Choosing each stone, and poising every weight,","Trying the measures of the breadth and height;","Here pulling down, and there erecting new,","Founding a firm state by proportions true.","","When Gideon so did from the war retreat,","Yet by the conquest of two kings grown great,","He on the peace extends a warlike power,","And Israel silent saw him raze the tower;","And how he Succorth's Elders durst suppress,","With thorns and briars of the wilderness.","No king might ever such a force have done;","Yet would not he be Lord, nor yet his son.","","Thou with the same strength, and an heart as plain,","Didst (like thine olive) still refuse to reign,","Though why should others all thy labour spoil,","And brambles be anointed with thine oil,","Whose climbing flame, without a timely stop,","Had quickly levelled every cedar's top?","Therefore first growing to thyself a law,","Th' ambitious shrubs thou in just time didst awe.","","So have I seen at sea, when whirling winds,","Hurry the bark, but more the seamen's minds,","Who with mistaken course salute the sand,","And threatening rocks misapprehend for land,","While baleful Tritons to the shipwreck guide,","And corposants along the tackling slide,","The passengers all wearied out before,","Giddy, and wishing for the fatal shore,","Some lusty mate, who with more careful eye","Counted the hours, and every star did spy,","The help does from the artless steersman strain,","And doubles back unto the safer main.","What though a while they grumble discontent,","Saving himself, he does their loss prevent.","","'Tis not a freedom, that where all command;","Nor tyranny, where one does them withstand:","But who of both the bounder knows to lay","Him as their father must the state obey.","","Thou, and thine house (like Noah's eight) did rest,","Left by the wars' flood on the mountains' crest:","And the large vale lay subject to thy will","Which thou but as an husbandman wouldst till:","And only didst for others plant the vine","Of liberty, not drunken with its wine.","","That sober liberty which men may have,","That they enjoy, but more they vainly crave:","And such as to their parents' tents do press,","May show their own, not see his nakedness.","","Yet such a Chammish issue still does rage,","The shame and plague both of the land and age,","Who watched thy halting, and thy fall deride,","Rejoicing when thy foot had slipped aside,","That their new king might the fifth sceptre shake,","And make the world, by his example, quake:","Whose frantic army should they want for men","Might muster heresies, so one were ten.","What thy misfortune, they the spirit call,","And their religion only is to fall.","Oh Mahomet! now couldst thou rise again,","Thy falling-sickness should have made thee reign,","While Feake and Simpson would in many a tome,","Have writ the comments of thy sacred foam:","For soon thou mightst have passed among their rant","Were't but for thine unmovиd tulipant;","As thou must needs have owned them of thy band","For prophecies fit to be Alcoraned.","","Accursиd locusts, whom your king does spit","Out of the centre of the unbottomed pit;","Wanderers, adulterers, liars, Munster's rest,","Sorcerers, athiests, jesuits possessed;","You who the scriptures and the laws deface","With the same liberty as points and lace;","Oh race most hypocritically strict!","Bent to reduce us to the ancient Pict;","Well may you act the Adam and the Eve;","Ay, and the serpent too that did deceive.","","But the great captain, now the danger's o'er,","Makes you for his sake tremble one fit more;","And, to your spite, returning yet alive","Does with himself all that is good revive.","","So when first man did through the morning new","See the bright sun his shining race pursue,","All day he followed with unwearied sight,","Pleased with that other world of moving light;","But thought him when he missed his setting beams,","Sunk in the hills, or plunged below the streams.","While dismal blacks hung round the universe,","And stars (like tapers) burned upon his hearse:","And owls and ravens with their screeching noise","Did make the funerals sadder by their joys.","His weeping eyes the doleful vigils keep,","Not knowing yet the night was made for sleep;","Still to the west, where he him lost, he turned,","And with such accents as despairing mourned:","`Why did mine eyes once see so bright a ray;","Or why day last no longer than a day?'","When straight the sun behind him he descried,","Smiling serenely from the further side.","","So while our star that gives us light and heat,","Seemed now a long and gloomy night to threat,","Up from the other world his flame he darts,","And princes (shining through their windows) starts,","Who their suspected counsellors refuse,","And credulous ambassadors accuse.","","`Is this', saith one, `the nation that we read","Spent with both wars, under a captain dead,","Yet rig a navy while we dress us late,","And ere we dine, raze and rebuild their state?","What oaken forests, and what golden mines!","What mints of men, what union of designs!","(Unless their ships, do, as their fowl proceed","Of shedding leaves, that with their ocean breed).","Theirs are not ships, but rather arks of war","And beakиd promontories sailed from far;","Of floating islands a new hatchиd nest;","A fleet of worlds, of other worlds in quest;","An hideous shoal of wood-leviathans,","Armed with three tier of brazen hurricanes,","That through the centre shoot their thundering side","And sink the earth that does at anchor ride.","What refuge to escape them can be found,","Whose watery leaguers all the world surround?","Needs must we all their tributaries be,","Whose navies hold the sluices of the sea.","The ocean is the fountain of command,","But that once took, we captives are on land.","And those that have the waters for their share,","Can quickly leave us neither earth nor air.","Yet if through these our fears could find a pass,","Through double oak, and lined with treble brass,","That one man still, although but named, alarms","More than all men, all navies, and all arms.","Him, in the day, him, in late night I dread,","And still his sword seems hanging o'er my head.","The nation had been ours, but his one soul","Moves the great bulk, and animates the whole.","He secrecy with number hath enchased,","Courage with age, maturity with haste:","The valiant's terror, riddle of the wise,","And still his falchion all our knots unties.","Where did he learn those arts that cost us dear?","Where below earth, or where above the sphere?","He seems a king by long succession born,","And yet the same to be a king does scorn.","Abroad a king he seems, and something more,","At home a subject on the equal floor.","O could I once him with our title see,","So should I hope that he might die as we.","But let them write is praise that love him best,","It grieves me sore to have thus much confessed.'","","Pardon, great Prince, if thus their fear of spite","More than our love and duty do thee right.","I yield, nor further will the prize contend,","So that we both alike may miss our end:","While thou thy venerable head dost raise","As far above their malice as my praise,","And as the Angel of our commonweal,","Troubling the waters, yearly mak'st them heal."],"linecount":"402"},{"title":"Upon Appleton House, to My Lord Fairfax","author":"Andrew Marvell","lines":["Within this sober Frame

'Tis thy state,","\"Not Thee, that they would consecrate.","\"Fly from their Ruine. How I fear","\"Though guiltless lest thou perish there.","","What should he do? He would respect","Religion, but not Right neglect:","For first Religion taught him Right,","And dazled not but clear'd his sight.","Sometimes resolv'd his Sword he draws,","But reverenceth then the Laws:","\"For Justice still that Courage led;","First from a Judge, then Souldier bred.","","Small Honour would be in the Storm.","The Court him grants the lawful Form;","Which licens'd either Peace or Force,","To hinder the unjust Divorce.","Yet still the Nuns his Right debar'd,","Standing upon their holy Guard.","Ill-counsell'd Women, do you know","Whom you resist, or what you do?","","Is not this he whose Offspring fierce","Shall fight through all the Universe;","And with successive Valour try","France, Poland, either Germany;","Till one, as long since prophecy'd,","His Horse through conquer'd Britain ride?","Yet, against Fate, his Spouse they kept;","And the great Race would intercept.","","Some to the Breach against their Foes","Their Wooden Saints in vain oppose","Another bolder stands at push","With their old Holy-Water Brush.","While the disjointed Abbess threads","The gingling Chain-shot of her Beads.","But their lowd'st Cannon were their Lungs;","And sharpest Weapons were their Tongues.","","But, waving these aside like Flyes,","Young Fairfax through the Wall does rise.","Then th' unfrequented Vault appear'd,","And superstitions vainly fear'd.","The Relicks False were set to view;","Only the Jewels there were true.","But truly bright and holy Thwaites","That weeping at the Altar waites.","","But the glad Youth away her bears,","And to the Nuns bequeaths her Tears:","Who guiltily their Prize bemoan,","Like Gipsies that a Child hath stoln.","Thenceforth (as when th' Inchantment ends","The Castle vanishes or rends)","The wasting Cloister with the rest","Was in one instant dispossest.","","At the demolishing, this Seat","To Fairfax fell as by Escheat.","And what both Nuns and Founders will'd","'Tis likely better thus fulfill'd,","For if the Virgin prov'd not theirs,","The Cloyster yet remained hers.","Though many a Nun there made her vow,","'Twas no Religious-House till now.","","From that blest Bed the Heroe came,","Whom France and Poland yet does fame:","Who, when retired here to Peace,","His warlike Studies could not cease;","But laid these Gardens out in sport","In the just Figure of a Fort;","And with five Bastions it did fence,","As aiming one for ev'ry Sense.","","When in the East the Morning Ray","Hangs out the Colours of the Day,","The Bee through these known Allies hums,","Beating the Dian with its Drumms.","Then Flow'rs their drowsie Eylids raise,","Their Silken Ensigns each displayes,","And dries its Pan yet dank with Dew,","And fills its Flask with Odours new.","","These, as their Governour goes by,","In fragrant Vollyes they let fly;","And to salute their Governess","Again as great a charge they press:","None for the Virgin Nymph; for She","Seems with the Flow'rs a Flow'r to be.","And think so still! though not compare","With Breath so sweet, or Cheek so faire.","","Well shot ye Fireman! Oh how sweet,","And round your equal Fires do meet;","Whose shrill report no Ear can tell,","But Ecchoes to the Eye and smell.","See how the Flow'rs, as at Parade,","Under their Colours stand displaid:","Each Regiment in order grows,","That of the Tulip Pinke and Rose.","","But when the vigilant Patroul","Of Stars walks round about the Pole,","Their Leaves, that to the stalks are curl'd,","Seem to their Staves the Ensigns furl'd.","Then in some Flow'rs beloved Hut","Each Bee as Sentinel is shut;","And sleeps so too: but, if once stir'd,","She runs you through, or askes The Word.","","Oh Thou, that dear and happy Isle","The Garden of the World ere while,","Thou Paradise of four Seas,","Which Heaven planted us to please,","But, to exclude the World, did guard","With watry if not flaming Sword;","What luckless Apple did we tast,","To make us Mortal, and The Wast.","","Unhappy! shall we never more","That sweet Milltia restore,","When Gardens only had their Towrs,","And all the Garrisons were Flow'rs,","When Roses only Arms might bear,","And Men did rosie Garlands wear?","Tulips, in several Colours barr'd,","Were then the Switzers of our Guard.","","The Gardiner had the Souldiers place,","And his more gentle Forts did trace.","The Nursery of all things green","Was then the only Magazeen.","The Winter Quarters were the Stoves,","Where he the tender Plants removes.","But War all this doth overgrow:","We Ord'nance Plant and Powder sow.","","And yet their walks one on the Sod","Who, had it pleased him and God,","Might once have made our Gardens spring","Fresh as his own and flourishing.","But he preferr'd to the Cinque Ports","These five imaginary Forts:","And, in those half-dry Trenches, spann'd","Pow'r which the Ocean might command.","","For he did, with his utmost Skill,","Ambition weed, but Conscience till.","Conscience, that Heaven-nursed Plant,","Which most our Earthly Gardens want.","A prickling leaf it bears, and such","As that which shrinks at ev'ry touch;","But Flow'rs eternal, and divine,","That in the Crowns of Saints do shine.","","The sight does from these Bastions ply,","Th' invisible Artilery;","And at proud Cawood Castle seems","To point the Battery of its Beams.","As if it quarrell'd in the Seat","Th' Ambition of its Prelate great.","But ore the Meads below it plays,","Or innocently seems to gaze.","","And now to the Abbyss I pass","Of that unfathomable Grass,","Where Men like Grashoppers appear,","But Grashoppers are Gyants there:","They, in there squeking Laugh, contemn","Us as we walk more low then them:","And, from the Precipices tall","Of the green spir's, to us do call.","","To see Men through this Meadow Dive,","We wonder how they rise alive.","As, under Water, none does know","Whether he fall through it or go.","But, as the Marriners that sound,","And show upon their Lead the Ground,","They bring up Flow'rs so to be seen,","And prove they've at the Bottom been.","","No Scene that turns with Engines strange","Does oftner then these Meadows change,","For when the Sun the Grass hath vext,","The tawny Mowers enter next;","Who seem like Israaliies to be,","Walking on foot through a green Sea.","To them the Grassy Deeps divide,","And crowd a Lane to either Side.","","With whistling Sithe, and Elbow strong,","These Massacre the Grass along:","While one, unknowing, carves the Rail,","Whose yet unfeather'd Quils her fail.","The Edge all bloody from its Breast","He draws, and does his stroke detest;","Fearing the Flesh untimely mow'd","To him a Fate as black forebode.","","But bloody Thestylis, that waites","To bring the mowing Camp their Cates,","Greedy as Kites has trust it up,","And forthwith means on it to sup:","When on another quick She lights,","And cryes, he call'd us Israelites;","But now, to make his saying true,","Rails rain for Quails, for Manna Dew.","","Unhappy Birds! what does it boot","To build below the Grasses Root;","When Lowness is unsafe as Hight,","And Chance o'retakes what scapeth spight?","And now your Orphan Parents Call","Sounds your untimely Funeral.","Death-Trumpets creak in such a Note,","And 'tis the Sourdine in their Throat.","","Or sooner hatch or higher build:","The Mower now commands the Field;","In whose new Traverse seemeth wrought","A Camp of Battail newly fought:","Where, as the Meads with Hay, the Plain","Lyes quilted ore with Bodies slain:","The Women that with forks it filing,","Do represent the Pillaging.","","And now the careless Victors play,","Dancing the Triumphs of the Hay;","Where every Mowers wholesome Heat","Smells like an Alexanders Sweat.","Their Females fragrant as the Mead","Which they in Fairy Circles tread:","When at their Dances End they kiss,","Their new-made Hay not sweeter is.","","When after this 'tis pil'd in Cocks,","Like a calm Sea it shews the Rocks:","We wondring in the River near","How Boats among them safely steer.","Or, like the Desert Memphis Sand,","Short Pyramids of Hay do stand.","And such the Roman Camps do rise","In Hills for Soldiers Obsequies.","","This Scene again withdrawing brings","A new and empty Face of things;","A levell'd space, as smooth and plain,","As Clothes for Lilly strecht to stain.","The World when first created sure","Was such a Table rase and pure.","Or rather such is the Toril","Ere the Bulls enter at Madril.","","For to this naked equal Flat,","Which Levellers take Pattern at,","The Villagers in common chase","Their Cattle, which it closer rase;","And what below the Sith increast","Is pincht yet nearer by the Breast.","Such, in the painted World, appear'd","Davenant with th'Universal Heard.","","They seem within the polisht Grass","A landskip drawen in Looking-Glass.","And shrunk in the huge Pasture show","As spots, so shap'd, on Faces do.","Such Fleas, ere they approach the Eye,","In Multiplyiug Glasses lye.","They feed so wide, so slowly move,","As Constellatious do above.","","Then, to conclude these pleasant Acts,","Denton sets ope its Cataracts;","And makes the Meadow truly be","(What it but seem'd before) a Sea.","For, jealous of its Lords long stay,","It try's t'invite him thus away.","The River in it self is drown'd,","And Isl's th' astonish Cattle round.","","Let others tell the Paradox,","How Eels now bellow in the Ox;","How Horses at their Tails do kick,","Turn'd as they hang to Leeches quick;","How Boats can over Bridges sail;","And Fishes do the Stables scale.","How Salmons trespassing are found;","And Pikes are taken in the Pound.","","But I, retiring from the Flood,","Take Sanctuary in the Wood;","And, while it lasts, my self imbark","In this yet green, yet growing Ark;","Where the first Carpenter might best","Fit Timber for his Keel have Prest.","And where all Creatures might have shares,","Although in Armies, not in Paires.","","The double Wood of ancient Stocks","Link'd in so thick, an Union locks,","It like two Pedigrees appears,","On one hand Fairfax, th' other Veres:","Of whom though many fell in War,","Yet more to Heaven shooting are:","And, as they Natures Cradle deckt,","Will in green Age her Hearse expect.","","When first the Eye this Forrest sees","It seems indeed as Wood not Trees:","As if their Neighbourhood so old","To one great Trunk them all did mold.","There the huge Bulk takes place, as ment","To thrust up a Fifth Element;","And stretches still so closely wedg'd","As if the Night within were hedg'd.","","Dark all without it knits; within","It opens passable and thin;","And in as loose an order grows,","As the Corinthean Porticoes.","The Arching Boughs unite between","The Columnes of the Temple green;","And underneath the winged Quires","Echo about their tuned Fires.","","The Nightingale does here make choice","To sing the Tryals of her Voice.","Low Shrubs she sits in, and adorns","With Musick high the squatted Thorns.","But highest Oakes stoop down to hear,","And listning

do burn!","","Then as I carless on the Bed","Of gelid Straw-berryes do tread,","And through the Hazles thick espy","The hatching Thrastles shining Eye,","The Heron from the Ashes top,","The eldest of

shines,","Narcissus like, the Sun too pines.","","Oh what a Pleasure 'tis to hedge","My Temples here with heavy sedge;","Abandoning my lazy Side,","Stretcht as a Bank unto the Tide;","Or to suspend my sliding Foot","On the Osiers undermined Root,","And in its Branches tough to hang,","While at my Lines the Fishes twang!","","But now away my Hooks, my Quills,","And Angles, idle Utensils.","The Young

which had so long the care","Of Cromwell's head, and numbered every hair,","Now in itself (the glass where all appears)","Had seen the period of his golden years:","And thenceforh only did attend to trace","What death might least so fair a life deface.","","The people, which what most they fear esteem,","Death when more horrid, so more noble deem,","And blame the last act, like spectators vain,","Unless the prince whom they applaud be slain.","Nor fate indeed can well refuse that right","To those that lived in war, to die in fight.","","But long his valour none had left that could","Endanger him, or clemency that would.","And he whom Nature all for peace had made,","But angry heaven unto war had swayed,","And so less useful where he most desired,","For what he least affected was admired,","Deservиd yet an end whose every part,","Should speak the wondrous softness of his heart.","","To Love and Grief the fatal writ was 'signed;","(Those nobler weaknesses of human kind,","From which those powers that issued the decree,","Although immortal, found they were not free),","That they, to whom his breast still open lies,","In gentle passions should his death disguise:","And leave succeeding ages cause to mourn,","As long as Grief shall weep, or Love shall burn.","","Straight does a slow and languishing disease","Eliza, Nature's and his darling, seize.","Her when an infant, taken with her charms,","He oft would flourish in his mighty arms,","And, lest their force the tender burden wrong,","Slacken the vigour of his muscles strong;","Then to the Mother's breast her softly move,","Which while she drained of milk, she filled with love.","But as with riper years her virtue grew,","And every minute adds a lustre new,","When with meridian height her beauty shined,","And thorough that sparkled her fairer mind,","When she with smiles serene in words discreet","His hidden soul at ever turn could meet;","Then might y'ha' daily his affection spied,","Doubling that knot which destiny had tied,","While they by sense, not knowing, comprehend","How on each other both their fates depend.","With her each day the pleasing hours he shares,","And at her aspect calms his growing cares;","Or with a grandsire's joy her children sees","Hanging about her neck or at his knees.","Hold fast, dear infants, hold them both or none;","This will not stay when once the other's gone.","","A silent fire now wastes those limbs of wax,","And him within his tortured image racks.","So the flower withering which the garden crowned,","The sad root pines in secret under ground.","Each groan he doubled and each sigh he sighed,","Repeated over to the restless night.","No trembling string composed to numbers new,","Answers the touch in notes more sad, more true.","She, lest he grieve, hides what she can her pains,","And he to lessen hers his sorrow feigns:","Yet both perceived, yet both concealed their skills,","And so diminishing increased their ills:","That whether by each other's grief they fell,","Or on their own redoubled, none can tell.","","And now Eliza's purple locks were shorn,","Where she so long her Father's fate had worn:","And frequent lightning to her soul that flies,","Divides the air, and opens all the skies:","And now his life, suspended by her breath,","Ran out impetuously to hasting death.","Like polished mirrors, so his steely breast","Had every figure of her woes expressed,","And with the damp of her last gasp obscured,","Had drawn such stains as were not to be cured.","Fate could not either reach with single stroke,","But the dear image fled, the mirror broke.","","Who now shall tell us more of mournful swans,","Of halcyons kind, or bleeding pelicans?","No downy breast did e'er so gently beat,","Or fan with airy plumes so soft an heat.","For he no duty by his height excused,","Nor, though a prince, to be a man refused:","But rather than in his Eliza's pain","Not love, not grieve, would neither live nor reign:","And in himself so oft immortal tried,","Yet in compassion of another died.","","So have I seen a vine, whose lasting age","Of many a winter hath survived the rage,","Under whose shady tent men every year","At its rich blood's expense their sorrow cheer,","If some dear branch where it extends its life","Chance to be pruned by an untimely knife,","The parent-tree unto the grief succeeds,","And through the wound its vital humour bleeds,","Trickling in watery drops, whose flowing shape","Weeps that it falls ere fixed into a grape.","So the dry stock, no more that spreading vine,","Frustrates the autumn and the hopes of wine.","","A secret cause does sure those signs ordain","Foreboding princes' falls, and seldom vain.","Whether some kinder powers that wish us well,","What they above cannot prevent foretell;","Or the great world do by consent presage,","As hollow seas with future tempests rage;","Or rather heaven, which us so long foresees,","Their funerals celebrates while it decrees.","But never yet was any human fate","By Nature solemnized with so much state.","He unconcerned the dreadful passage crossed;","But, oh, what pangs that death did Nature cost!","","First the great thunder was shot off, and sent","The signal from the starry battlement.","The winds receive it, and its force outdo,","As practising how they could thunder too;","Out of the binder's hand the sheaves they tore,","And thrashed the harvest in the airy floor;","Or of huge trees, whose growth with his did rise,","The deep foundations opened to the skies.","Then heavy show'rs the wingиd tempests lead,","And pour the deluge o'er the chaos' head.","The race of warlike horses at his tomb","Offer themselves in many a hecatomb;","With pensive head towards the ground they fall,","And helpless languish at the tainted stall.","Numbers of men decrease with pains unknown,","And hasten, not to see his death, their own.","Such tortures all the elements unfixed,","Troubled to part where so exactly mixed.","And as through air his wasting spirits flowed,","The universe laboured beneath their load.","","Nature, it seemed with him would Nature vie;","He with Eliza. It with him would die,","He without noise still travelled to his end,","As silent suns to meet the night descend.","The stars that for him fought had only power","Left to determine now his final hour,","Which, since they might not hinder, yet they cast","To choose it worthy of his glories past.","","No part of time but bare his mark away","Of honour; all the year was Cromwell's day:","But this, of all the most ausicious found,","Twice had in open field him victor crowned:","When up the armиd mountains of Dunbar","He marched, and through deep Severn ending war.","What day should him eternize but the same","That had before immortalized his name?","That so who ere would at his death have joyed,","In their own griefs might find themselves employed;","But those that sadly his departure grieved,","Yet joyed, remebering what he once achieved.","And the last minute his victorious ghost","Gave chase to Ligny on the Belgic coast.","Here ended all his mortal toils: he laid","And slept in place under the laurel shade.","","O Cromwell, Heaven's Favourite! To none","Have such high honours from above been shown:","For whom the elements we mourners see,","And heaven itself would the great herald be,","Which with more care set forth his obsequies","Than those of Moses hid from human eyes,","As jealous only here lest all be less,","That we could to his memory express.","Then let us to our course of mourning keep:","Where heaven leads, 'tis piety to weep.","Stand back, ye seas, and shrunk beneath the veil","Of your abyss, with covered head bewail","Your Monarch: we demand not your supplies","To compass in our isle; our tears suffice:","Since him away the dismal tempest rent,","Who once more joined us to the continent;","Who planted England on the Flandric shore,","And stretched our frontier to the Indian ore;","Whose greater truths obscure the fables old,","Whether of British saints or Worthies told;","And in a valour lessening Arthur's deeds,","For holiness the Confessor exceeds.","","He first put arms into Religion's hand,","And timorous Conscience unto Courage manned:","The soldier taught that inward mail to wear,","And fearing God how they should nothing fear.","`Those strokes,' he said, `will pierce through all below","Where those that strike from heaven fetch their blow.'","Astonished armies did their flight prepare,","And cities strong were stormиd by his prayer;","Of that, forever Preston's field shall tell","The story, and impregnable Clonmel.","And where the sandy mountain Fenwick scaled,","The sea between, yet hence his prayer prevailed.","What man was ever so in heaven obeyed","Since the commanded sun o'er Gideon stayed?","In all his wars needs must he triumph when","He conquered God still ere he fought with men:","","Hence, though in battle none so brave or fierce,","Yet him the adverse steel could never pierce.","Pity it seemed to hurt him more that felt","Each wound himself which he to others dealt;","Danger itself refusing to offend","So loose an enemy, so fast a friend.","","Friendship, that sacred virtue, long does claim","The first foundation of his house and name:","But within one its narrow limits fall,","His tenderness extended unto all.","And that deep soul through every channel flows,","Where kindly nature loves itself to lose.","More strong affections never reason served,","Yet still affected most what best deserved.","If he Eliza loved to that degree,","(Though who more worthy to be loved than she?)","If so indulgent to his own, how dear","To him the children of the highest were?","For her he once did nature's tribute pay:","For these his life adventured every day:","And 'twould be found, could we his thoughts have cast,","Their griefs struck deepest, if Eliza's last.","","What prudence more than human did he need","To keep so dear, so differing minds agreed?","The worser sort, as conscious of their ill,","Lie weak and easy to the ruler's will;","But to the good (too many or too few)","All law is useless, all reward is due.","Oh ill-advised, if not for love, for shame,","Spare yet your own, if you neglect his fame;","Lest others dare to think your zeal a mask,","And you to govern, only heaven's task.","","Valour, religion, friendship, prudence died","At once with him, and all that's good beside;","And we death's refuse, nature's dregs, confined","To loathsome life, alas! are left behind.","Where we (so once we used) shall now no more","To fetch the day, press about his chamber door--","From which he issued with that awful state,","It seemd Mars broke through Janus' double gate,","Yet always tempered with an air so mild,","No April suns that e'er so gently smiled--","No more shall hear that powerful language charm,","Whose force oft spared the labour of his arm:","No more shall follow where he spent the days","In war, in counsel, or in prayer and praise,","Whose meanest acts he would himself advance,","As ungirt David to the ark did dance.","All, all is gone of our or his delight","In horses fierce, wild deer, or armour bright;","Francisca fair can nothing now but weep,","Nor with soft notes shall sing his cares asleep.","","I saw him dead.

them up with pain and care,","Nor cost, nor labour did I spare,","Till at the last they felt their wing,","Mounted the trees, and learned to sing;","Chief of the brood then took his flight","To regions far and left me quite.","My mournful chirps I after send,","Till he return, or I do end:","Leave not thy nest, thy dam and sire,","Fly back and sing amidst this choir.","My second bird did take her flight,","And with her mate flew out of sight;","Southward they both their course did bend,","And seasons twain they there did spend,","Till after blown by southern gales,","They norward steered with filled sails.","A prettier bird was no where seen,","Along the beach among the treen.","I have a third of colour white,","On whom I placed no small delight;","Coupled with mate loving and true,","Hath also bid her dam adieu;","And where Aurora first appears,","She now hath perched to spend her years.","One to the academy flew","To chat among that learned crew;","Ambition moves still in his breast","That he might chant above the rest","Striving for more than to do well,","That nightingales he might excel.","My fifth, whose down is yet scarce gone,","Is 'mongst the shrubs and bushes flown,","And as his wings increase in strength,","On higher boughs he'll perch at length.","My other three still with me nest,","Until they're grown, then as the rest,","Or here or there they'll take their flight,","As is ordained, so shall they light.","If birds could weep, then would my tears","Let others know what are my fears","Lest this my brood some harm should catch,","And be surprised for want of watch,","Whilst pecking corn and void of care,","They fall un'wares in fowler's snare,","Or whilst on trees they sit and sing,","Some untoward boy at them do fling,","Or whilst allured with bell and glass,","The net be spread, and caught, alas.","Or lest by lime-twigs they be foiled,","Or by some greedy hawks be spoiled.","O would my young, ye saw my breast,","And knew what thoughts there sadly rest,","Great was my pain when I you fed,","Long did I keep you soft and warm,","And with my wings kept off all harm,","My cares are more and fears than ever,","My throbs such now as 'fore were never.","Alas, my birds, you wisdom want,","Of perils you are ignorant;","Oft times in grass, on trees, in flight,","Sore accidents on you may light.","O to your safety have an eye,","So happy may you live and die.","Meanwhile my days in tunes I'll spend,","Till my weak lays with me shall end.","In shady woods I'll sit and sing,","And things that past to mind I'll bring.","Once young and pleasant, as are you,","But former toys (no joys) adieu.","My age I will not once lament,","But sing, my time so near is spent.","And from the top bough take my flight","Into a country beyond sight,","Where old ones instantly grow young,","And there with seraphims set song;","No seasons cold, nor storms they see;","But spring lasts to eternity.","When each of you shall in your nest","Among your young ones take your rest,","In chirping language, oft them tell,","You had a dam that loved you well,","That did what could be done for young,","And nursed you up till you were strong,","And

Youth, the Manly, and Old-age.","1.3 The first: son unto Phlegm, grand-child to water,","1.4 Unstable, supple, moist, and cold's his Nature.","1.5 The second: frolic claims his pedigree;","1.6 From blood and air, for hot and moist is he.","1.7 The third of fire and choler is compos'd,","1.8 Vindicative, and quarrelsome dispos'd.","1.9 The last, of earth and heavy melancholy,","1.10 Solid, hating all lightness, and all folly.","1.11 Childhood was cloth'd in white, and given to show,","1.12 His spring was intermixed with some snow.","1.13 Upon his head a Garland Nature set:","1.14 Of Daisy, Primrose, and the Violet.","1.15 Such cold mean flowers (as these) blossom betime,","1.16 Before the Sun hath throughly warm'd the clime.","1.17 His hobby striding, did not ride, but run,","1.18 And in his hand an hour-glass new begun,","1.19 In dangers every moment of a fall,","1.20 And when 'tis broke, then ends his life and all.","1.21 But if he held till it have run its last,","1.22 Then may he live till threescore years or past.","1.23 Next, youth came up in gorgeous attire","1.24 (As that fond age, doth most of all desire),","1.25 His Suit of Crimson, and his Scarf of Green.","1.26 In's countenance, his pride quickly was seen.","1.27 Garland of Roses, Pinks, and Gillyflowers","1.28 Seemed to grow on's head (bedew'd with showers).","1.29 His face as fresh, as is Aurora fair,","1.30 When blushing first, she 'gins to red the Air.","1.31 No wooden horse, but one of metal try'd:","1.32 He seems to fly, or swim, and not to ride.","1.33 Then prancing on the Stage, about he wheels;","1.34 But as he went, death waited at his heels.","1.35 The next came up, in a more graver sort,","1.36 As one that cared for a good report.","1.37 His Sword by's side, and choler in his eyes,","1.38 But neither us'd (as yet) for he was wise,","1.39 Of Autumn fruits a basket on his arm,","1.40 His golden rod in's purse, which was his charm.","1.41 And last of all, to act upon this Stage,","1.42 Leaning upon his staff, comes up old age.","1.43 Under his arm a Sheaf of wheat he bore,","1.44 A Harvest of the best: what needs he more?","1.45 In's other hand a glass, ev'n almost run,","1.46 This writ about: This out, then I am done.","1.47 His hoary hairs and grave aspect made way,","1.48 And all gave ear to what he had to say.","1.49 These being met, each in his equipage","1.50 Intend to speak, according to their age,","1.51 But wise Old-age did with all gravity","1.52 To childish childhood give precedency,","1.53 And to the rest, his reason mildly told:","1.54 That he was young, before he grew so old.","1.55 To do as he, the rest full soon assents,","1.56 Their method was that of the Elements,","1.57 That each should tell what of himself he knew,","1.58 Both good and bad, but yet no more then's true.","1.59 With heed now stood, three ages of frail man,","1.60 To hear the child, who crying, thus began.","","Childhood.","","2.1 Ah me! conceiv'd in sin, and born in sorrow,","2.2 A nothing, here to day, but gone to morrow,","2.3 Whose mean beginning, blushing can't reveal,","2.4 But night and darkness must with shame conceal.","2.5 My mother's breeding sickness, I will spare,","2.6 Her nine months' weary burden not declare.","2.7 To shew her bearing pangs, I should do wrong,","2.8 To tell that pain, which can't be told by tongue.","2.9 With tears into this world I did arrive;","2.10 My mother still did waste, as I did thrive,","2.11 Who yet with love and all alacity,","2.12 Spending was willing to be spent for me.","2.13 With wayward cries, I did disturb her rest,","2.14 Who sought still to appease me with her breast;","2.15 With weary arms, she danc'd, and By, By, sung,","2.16 When wretched I (ungrate) had done the wrong.","2.17 When Infancy was past, my Childishness","2.18 Did act all folly that it could express.","2.19 My silliness did only take delight,","2.20 In that which riper age did scorn and slight,","2.21 In Rattles, Bables, and such toyish stuff.","2.22 My then ambitious thoughts were low enough.","2.23 My high-born soul so straitly was confin'd","2.24 That its own worth it did not know nor mind.","2.25 This little house of flesh did spacious count,","2.26 Through ignorance, all troubles did surmount,","2.27 Yet this advantage had mine ignorance,","2.28 Freedom from Envy and from Arrogance.","2.29 How to be rich, or great, I did not cark,","2.30 A Baron or a Duke ne'r made my mark,","2.31 Nor studious was, Kings favours how to buy,","2.32 With costly presents, or base flattery;","2.33 No office coveted, wherein I might","2.34 Make strong my self and turn aside weak right.","2.35 No malice bare to this or that great Peer,","2.36 Nor unto buzzing whisperers gave ear.","2.37 I gave no hand, nor vote, for death, of life.","2.38 I'd nought to do, 'twixt Prince, and peoples' strife.","2.39 No Statist I: nor Marti'list i' th' field.","2.40 Where e're I went, mine innocence was shield.","2.41 My quarrels, not for Diadems, did rise,","2.42 But for an Apple, Plumb, or some such prize.","2.43 My strokes did cause no death, nor wounds, nor scars.","2.44 My little wrath did cease soon as my wars.","2.45 My duel was no challenge, nor did seek.","2.46 My foe should weltering, with his bowels reek.","2.47 I had no Suits at law, neighbours to vex,","2.48 Nor evidence for land did me perplex.","2.49 I fear'd no storms, nor all the winds that blows.","2.50 I had no ships at Sea, no fraughts to loose.","2.51 I fear'd no drought, nor wet; I had no crop,","2.52 Nor yet on future things did place my hope.","2.53 This was mine innocence, but oh the seeds","2.54 Lay raked up of all the cursed weeds,","2.55 Which sprouted forth in my insuing age,","2.56 As he can tell, that next comes on the stage.","2.57 But yet me let me relate, before I go,","2.58 The sins and dangers I am subject to:","2.59 From birth stained, with Adam's sinful fact,","2.60 From thence I 'gan to sin, as soon as act;","2.61 A perverse will, a love to what's forbid;","2.62 A serpent's sting in pleasing face lay hid;","2.63 A lying tongue as soon as it could speak","2.64 And fifth Commandment do daily break;","2.65 Oft stubborn, peevish, sullen, pout, and cry;","2.66 Then nought can please, and yet I know not why.","2.67 As many was my sins, so dangers too,","2.68 For sin brings sorrow, sickness, death, and woe,","2.69 And though I miss the tossings of the mind,","2.70 Yet griefs in my frail flesh I still do find.","2.71 What gripes of wind, mine infancy did pain?","2.72 What tortures I, in breeding teeth sustain?","2.73 What crudities my cold stomach hath bred?","2.74 Whence vomits, worms, and flux have issued?","2.75 What breaches, knocks, and falls I daily have?","2.76 And some perhaps, I carry to my grave.","2.77 Sometimes in fire, sometimes in water fall:","2.78 Strangely preserv'd, yet mind it not at all.","2.79 At home, abroad, my danger's manifold","2.80 That wonder 'tis, my glass till now doth hold.","2.81 I've done: unto my elders I give way,","2.82 For 'tis but little that a child can say.","","Youth.","","","3.1 My goodly clothing and beauteous skin","3.2 Declare some greater riches are within,","3.3 But what is best I'll first present to view,","3.4 And then the worst, in a more ugly hue,","3.5 For thus to do we on this Stage assemble,","3.6 Then let not him, which hath most craft dissemble.","3.7 Mine education, and my learning's such,","3.8 As might my self, and others, profit much:","3.9 With nurture trained up in virtue's Schools;","3.10 Of Science, Arts, and Tongues, I know the rules;","3.11 The manners of the Court, I likewise know,","3.12 Nor ignorant what they in Country do.","3.13 The brave attempts of valiant Knights I prize","3.14 That dare climb Battlements, rear'd to the skies.","3.15 The snorting Horse, the Trumpet, Drum I like,","3.16 The glist'ring Sword, and well advanced Pike.","3.17 I cannot lie in trench before a Town,","3.18 Nor wait til good advice our hopes do crown.","3.19 I scorn the heavy Corslet, Musket-proof;","3.20 I fly to catch the Bullet that's aloof.","3.21 Though thus in field, at home, to all most kind,","3.22 So affable that I do suit each mind,","3.23 I can insinuate into the breast","3.24 And by my mirth can raise the heart deprest.","3.25 Sweet Music rapteth my harmonious Soul,","3.26 And elevates my thoughts above the Pole.","3.27 My wit, my bounty, and my courtesy","3.28 Makes all to place their future hopes on me.","3.29 This is my best, but youth (is known) alas,","3.30 To be as wild as is the snuffing Ass,","3.31 As vain as froth, as vanity can be,","3.32 That who would see vain man may look on me:","3.33 My gifts abus'd, my education lost,","3.34 My woful Parents' longing hopes all crost;","3.35 My wit evaporates in merriment;","3.36 My valour in some beastly quarrel's spent;","3.37 Martial deeds I love not, 'cause they're virtuous,","3.38 But doing so, might seem magnanimous.","3.39 My Lust doth hurry me to all that's ill,","3.40 I know no Law, nor reason, but my will;","3.41 Sometimes lay wait to take a wealthy purse","3.42 Or stab the man in's own defence, that's worse.","3.43 Sometimes I cheat (unkind) a female Heir","3.44 Of all at once, who not so wise, as fair,","3.45 Trusteth my loving looks and glozing tongue","3.46 Until her friends, treasure, and honour's gone.","3.47 Sometimes I sit carousing others' health","3.48 Until mine own be gone, my wit, and wealth.","3.49 From pipe to pot, from pot to words and blows,","3.50 For he that loveth Wine wanteth no woes.","3.51 Days, nights, with Ruffins, Roarers, Fiddlers spend,","3.52 To all obscenity my ears I bend,","3.53 All counsel hate which tends to make me wise,","3.54 And dearest friends count for mine enemies.","3.55 If any care I take, 'tis to be fine,","3.56 For sure my suit more than my virtues shine.","3.57 If any time from company I spare,","3.58 'Tis spent in curling, frisling up my hair,","3.59 Some young Adonais I do strive to be.","3.60 Sardana Pallas now survives in me.","3.61 Cards, Dice, and Oaths, concomitant, I love;","3.62 To Masques, to Plays, to Taverns still I move;","3.63 And in a word, if what I am you'd hear,","3.64 Seek out a British, bruitish Cavalier.","3.65 Such wretch, such monster am I; but yet more","3.66 I want a heart all this for to deplore.","3.67 Thus, thus alas! I have mispent my time,","3.68 My youth, my best, my strength, my bud, and prime,","3.69 Remembring not the dreadful day of Doom,","3.70 Nor yet the heavy reckoning for to come,","3.71 Though dangers do attend me every hour","3.72 And ghastly death oft threats me with her power:","3.73 Sometimes by wounds in idle combats taken,","3.74 Sometimes by Agues all my body shaken;","3.75 Sometimes by Fevers, all my moisture drinking,","3.76 My heart lies frying, and my eyes are sinking.","3.77 Sometimes the Cough, Stitch, painful Pleurisy,","3.78 With sad affrights of death, do menace me.","3.79 Sometimes the loathsome Pox my face be-mars","3.80 With ugly marks of his eternal scars.","3.81 Sometimes the Frenzy strangely mads my Brain","3.82 That oft for it in Bedlam I remain.","3.83 Too many's my Diseases to recite,","3.84 That wonder 'tis I yet behold the light,","3.85 That yet my bed in darkness is not made,","3.86 And I in black oblivion's den long laid.","3.87 Of Marrow full my bones, of Milk my breasts,","3.88 Ceas'd by the gripes of Serjeant Death's Arrests:","3.89 Thus I have said, and what I've said you see,","3.90 Childhood and youth is vain, yea vanity.","","Middle Age.","","","4.1 Childhood and youth forgot, sometimes I've seen,","4.2 And now am grown more staid that have been green,","4.3 What they have done, the same was done by me:","4.4 As was their praise, or shame, so mine must be.","4.5 Now age is more, more good ye do expect;","4.6 But more my age, the more is my defect.","4.7 But what's of worth, your eyes shall first behold,","4.8 And then a world of dross among my gold.","4.9 When my Wild Oats were sown, and ripe, and mown,","4.10 I then receiv'd a harvest of mine own.","4.11 My reason, then bad judge, how little hope","4.12 Such empty seed should yield a better crop.","4.13 I then with both hands graspt the world together,","4.14 Thus out of one extreme into another,","4.15 But yet laid hold on virtue seemingly:","4.16 Who climbs without hold, climbs dangerously.","4.17 Be my condition mean, I then take pains","4.18 My family to keep, but not for gains.","4.19 If rich, I'm urged then to gather more","4.20 To bear me out i' th' world and feed the poor;","4.21 If a father, then for children must provide,","4.22 But if none, then for kindred near ally'd;","4.23 If Noble, then mine honour to maintain;","4.24 If not, yet wealth, Nobility can gain.","4.25 For time, for place, likewise for each relation,","4.26 I wanted not my ready allegation.","4.27 Yet all my powers for self-ends are not spent,","4.28 For hundreds bless me for my bounty sent,","4.29 Whose loins I've cloth'd, and bellies I have fed,","4.30 With mine own fleece, and with my household bread.","4.31 Yea, justice I have done, was I in place,","4.32 To cheer the good and wicked to deface.","4.33 The proud I crush'd, th'oppressed I set free,","4.34 The liars curb'd but nourisht verity.","4.35 Was I a pastor, I my flock did feed","4.36 And gently lead the lambs, as they had need.","4.37 A Captain I, with skill I train'd my band","4.38 And shew'd them how in face of foes to stand.","4.39 If a Soldier, with speed I did obey","4.40 As readily as could my Leader say.","4.41 Was I a laborer, I wrought all day","4.42 As cheerfully as ere I took my pay.","4.43 Thus hath mine age (in all) sometimes done well;","4.44 Sometimes mine age (in all) been worse than hell.","4.45 In meanness, greatness, riches, poverty","4.46 Did toil, did broil; oppress'd, did steal and lie.","4.47 Was I as poor as poverty could be,","4.48 Then baseness was companion unto me.","4.49 Such scum as Hedges and High-ways do yield,","4.50 As neither sow, nor reap, nor plant, nor build.","4.51 If to Agriculture I was ordain'd,","4.52 Great labours, sorrows, crosses I sustain'd.","4.53 The early Cock did summon, but in vain,","4.54 My wakeful thoughts up to my painful gain.","4.55 For restless day and night, I'm robb'd of sleep","4.56 By cankered care, who sentinel doth keep.","4.57 My weary breast rest from his toil can find,","4.58 But if I rest, the more distrest my mind.","4.59 If happiness my sordidness hath found,","4.60 'Twas in the crop of my manured ground:","4.61 My fatted Ox, and my exuberous Cow,","4.62 My fleeced Ewe, and ever farrowing Sow.","4.63 To greater things I never did aspire,","4.64 My dunghill thoughts or hopes could reach no higher.","4.65 If to be rich, or great, it was my fate.","4.66 How was I broil'd with envy, and with hate?","4.67 Greater than was the great'st was my desire,","4.68 And greater still, did set my heart on fire.","4.69 If honour was the point to which I steer'd,","4.70 To run my hull upon disgrace I fear'd,","4.71 But by ambitious sails I was so carried","4.72 That over flats, and sands, and rocks I hurried,","4.73 Opprest, and sunk, and sack'd, all in my way","4.74 That did oppose me to my longed bay.","4.75 My thirst was higher than Nobility","4.76 And oft long'd sore to taste on Royalty,","4.77 Whence poison, Pistols, and dread instruments","4.78 Have been curst furtherers of mine intents.","4.79 Nor Brothers, Nephews, Sons, nor Sires I've spar'd.","4.80 When to a Monarchy my way they barr'd,","4.81 There set, I rid my self straight out of hand","4.82 Of such as might my son, or his withstand,","4.83 Then heapt up gold and riches as the clay,","4.84 Which others scatter like the dew in May.","4.85 Sometimes vain-glory is the only bait","4.86 Whereby my empty school is lur'd and caught.","4.87 Be I of worth, of learning, or of parts,","4.88 I judge I should have room in all men's hearts;","4.89 And envy gnaws if any do surmount.","4.90 I hate for to be had in small account.","4.91 If Bias like, I'm stript unto my skin;","4.92 I glory in my wealth I have within.","4.93 Thus good, and bad, and what I am, you see,","4.94 Now in a word, what my diseases be:","4.95 The vexing Stone, in bladder and in reins,","4.96 Torments me with intolerable pains;","4.97 The windy cholic oft my bowels rend,","4.98 To break the darksome prison, where it's penn'd;","4.99 The knotty Gout doth sadly torture me,","4.100 And the restraining lame Sciatica;","4.101 The Quinsy and the Fevers often distaste me,","4.102 And the Consumption to the bones doth waste me,","4.103 Subject to all Diseases, that's the truth,","4.104 Though some more incident to age, or youth;","4.105 And to conclude, I may not tedious be,","4.106 Man at his best estate is vanity.","","Old Age.","","5.1 What you have been, ev'n such have I before,","5.2 And all

Death's Warfare, to discharge.","5.15 It's not my goodly house, nor bed of down,","5.16 That can refresh, or ease, if Conscience frown;","5.17 Nor from alliance now can I have hope,","5.18 But what I

for love is not so light","As straight to burn at first beholder's sight.","","But they, which love indeed, look otherwise,","With pure regard and spotless true intent,","Drawing out of the object of their eyes","A more refined form, which they present","Unto their mind, void of all blemishment;","Which it reducing to her first perfection,","Beholdeth free from flesh's frail infection.","","And then conforming it unto the light,","Which in itself it hath remaining still,","Of that first Sun, yet sparkling in his sight,","Thereof he fashions in his higher skill","An heavenly beauty to his fancy's will;","And it embracing in his mind entire,","The mirror of his own thought doth admire.","","Which seeing now so inly fair to be,","As outward it appeareth to the eye,","And with his spirit's proportion to agree,","He thereon fixeth all his fantasy,","And fully setteth his felicity;","Counting it fairer than it is indeed,","And yet indeed her fairness doth exceed.","","For lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be","Than other men's, and in dear love's delight","See more than any other eyes can see,","Through mutual receipt of beam{\"e}s bright,","Which carry privy message to the spright,","And to their eyes that inmost fair display,","As plain as light discovers dawning day.","","Therein they see, through amorous eye-glances,","Armies of loves still flying to and fro,","Which dart at them their little fiery lances;","Whom having wounded, back again they go,","Carrying compassion to their lovely foe;","Who, seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect,","Cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect.","","In which how many wonders do they rede","To their conceit, that others never see,","Now of her smiles, with which their souls they feed,","Like gods with nectar in their banquets free;","Now of her looks, which like to cordials be;","But when her words' embássade forth she sends,","Lord, how sweet music that unto them lends.","","Sometimes upon her forehead they behold","A thousand graces masking in delight;","Sometimes within her eyelids they unfold","Ten thousand sweet belgards, which to their sight","Do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night;","But on her lips, like rosy buds in May,","So many millions of chaste pleasures play.","","All those, O Cytherea, and thousands more","Thy handmaids be, which do on thee attend,","To deck thy beauty with their dainties' store,","That may it more to mortal eyes commend,","And make it more admir'd of foe and friend:","That in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install,","And spread thy lovely kingdom over all.","","Then Iö, triumph! O great Beauty's Queen,","Advance the banner of thy conquest high,","That all this world, the which thy vassals bene,","May draw to thee, and with due fealty","Adore the power of thy great majesty,","Singing this hymn in honour of thy name,","Compil'd by me, which thy poor liegeman am.","","In lieu whereof grant, O great sovereign,","That she whose conquering beauty doth captive","My trembling heart in her eternal chain,","One drop of grace at length will to me give,","That I her bounden thrall by her may live,","And this same life, which first fro me she reaved,","May owe to her, of whom I it received.","","And you, fair Venus' darling, my dear dread,","Fresh flower of grace, great goddess of my life,","When your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read,","Deign to let fall

Hymn Of Heavenly Beauty","author":"Edmund Spenser","lines":["Rapt with the rage of mine own ravish'd thought,","Through contemplation of those goodly sights,","And glorious images in heaven wrought,","Whose wondrous beauty, breathing sweet delights","Do kindle love in high-conceited sprights;","I fain to tell the things that I behold,","But feel my wits to fail, and tongue to fold.","","Vouchsafe then, O thou most Almighty Spright,","From whom all gifts of wit and knowledge flow,","To shed into my breast some sparkling light","Of thine eternal truth, that I may show","Some little beams to mortal eyes below","Of that immortal beauty, there with thee,","Which in my weak distraughted mind I see;","","That with the glory of so goodly sight","The hearts of men, which fondly here admire","Fair seeming shews, and feed on vain delight,","Transported with celestial desire","Of those fair forms, may lift themselves up higher,","And learn to love, with zealous humble duty,","Th' eternal fountain of that heavenly beauty.","","Beginning then below, with th' easy view","Of this base world, subject to fleshly eye,","From thence to mount aloft, by order due,","To contemplation of th' immortal sky;","Of the soare falcon so I learn to fly,","That flags awhile her fluttering wings beneath,","Till she herself for stronger flight can breathe.","","Then look, who list thy gazeful eyes to feed","With sight of that is fair, look on the frame","Of this wide universe, and therein reed","The endless kinds of creatures which by name","Thou canst not count, much less their natures aim;","All which are made with wondrous wise respect,","And all with admirable beauty deckt.","","First th' earth, on adamantine pillars founded,","Amid the sea engirt with brazen bands;","Then th' air still flitting, but yet firmly bounded","On every side, with piles of flaming brands,","Never consum'd, nor quench'd with mortal hands;","And last, that mighty shining crystal wall,","Wherewith he hath encompassed this All.","","By view whereof it plainly may appear,","That still as every thing doth upward tend,","And further is from earth, so still more clear","And fair it grows, till to his perfect end","Of purest beauty it at last ascend;","Air more than water, fire much more than air,","And heaven than fire, appears more pure and fair.","","Look thou no further, but affix thine eye","On that bright, shiny, round, still moving mass,","The house of blessed gods, which men call sky,","All sow'd with glist'ring stars more thick than grass,","Whereof each other doth in brightness pass,","But those two most, which ruling night and day,","As king and queen, the heavens' empire sway;","","And tell me then, what hast thou ever seen","That to their beauty may compared be,","Or can the sight that is most sharp and keen","Endure their captain's flaming head to see?","How much less those, much higher in degree,","And so much fairer, and much more than these,","As these are fairer than the land and seas?","","For far above these heavens, which here we see,","Be others far exceeding these in light,","Not bounded, not corrupt, as these same be,","But infinite in largeness and in height,","Unmoving, uncorrupt, and spotless bright,","That need no sun t' illuminate their spheres,","But their own native light far passing theirs.","","And as these heavens still by degrees arise,","Until they come to their first Mover's bound,","That in his mighty compass doth comprise,","And carry all the rest with him around;","So those likewise do by degrees redound,","And rise more fair; till they at last arrive","To the most fair, whereto they all do strive.","","Fair is the heaven where happy souls have place,","In full enjoyment of felicity,","Whence they do still behold the glorious face","Of the divine eternal Majesty;","More fair is that, where those Ideas on high","Enranged be, which Plato so admired,","And pure Intelligences from God inspired.","","Yet fairer is that heaven, in which do reign","The sovereign Powers and mighty Potentates,","Which in their high protections do contain","All mortal princes and imperial states;","And fairer yet, whereas the royal Seats","And heavenly Dominations are set,","From whom all earthly governance is fet.","","Yet far more fair be those bright Cherubins,","Which all with golden wings are overdight,","And those eternal burning Seraphins,","Which from their faces dart out fiery light;","Yet fairer than they both, and much more bright,","Be th' Angels and Archangels, which attend","On God's own person, without rest or end.","","These thus in fair each other far excelling,","As to the highest they approach more near,","Yet is that highest far beyond all telling,","Fairer than all the rest which there appear,","Though all their beauties join'd together were;","How then can mortal tongue hope to express","The image of such endless perfectness?","","Cease then, my tongue, and lend unto my mind","Leave to bethink how great that beauty is,","Whose utmost parts so beautiful I find;","How much more those essential parts of his,","His truth, his love, his wisdom, and his bliss,","His grace, his doom, his mercy, and his might,","By which he lends us of himself a sight.","","Those unto all he daily doth display,","And shew himself in th' image of his grace,","As in a looking-glass, through which he may","Be seen of all his creatures vile and base,","That are unable else to see his face,","His glorious face which glistereth else so bright,","That th' Angels selves cannot endure his sight.","","But we, frail wights, whose sight cannot sustain","The sun's bright beams when he on us doth shine,","But that their points rebutted back again","Are dull'd, how can we see with feeble eyne","The glory of that Majesty Divine,","In sight of whom both sun and moon are dark,","Compared to his least resplendent spark?","","The means, therefore, which unto us is lent","Him to behold, is on his works to look,","Which he hath made in beauty excellent,","And in the same, as in a brazen book,","To read enregister'd in every nook","His goodness, which his beauty doth declare;","For all that's good is beautiful and fair.","","Thence gathering plumes of perfect speculation,","To imp the wings of thy high-flying mind,","Mount up aloft through heavenly contemplation,","From this dark world, whose damps the soul so blind,","And, like the native brood of eagles' kind,","On that bright Sun of Glory fix thine eyes,","Clear'd from gross mists of frail infirmities.","","Humbled with fear and awful reverence,","Before the footstool of his majesty","Throw thyself down, with trembling innocence,","Ne dare look up with corruptible eye","On the dread face of that great Deity,","For fear, lest if he chance to look on thee,","Thou turn to nought, and quite confounded be.","","But lowly fall before his mercy seat,","Close covered with the Lamb's integrity","From the just wrath of his avengeful threat","That sits upon the righteous throne on high;","His throne is built upon eternity,","More firm and durable than steel or brass,","Or the hard diamond, which them both doth pass.","","His sceptre is the rod of righteousness,","With which he bruiseth all his foes to dust,","And the great Dragon strongly doth repress,","Under the rigour of his judgement just;","His seat is truth, to which the faithful trust,","From whence proceed her beams so pure and bright","That all about him sheddeth glorious light:","","Light far exceeding that bright blazing spark","Which darted is from Titan's flaming head,","That with his beams enlumineth the dark","And dampish air, whereby all things are read;","Whose nature yet so much is marvelled","Of mortal wits, that it doth much amaze","The greatest wizards which thereon do gaze.","","But that immortal light, which there doth shine,","Is many thousand times more bright, more clear,","More excellent, more glorious, more divine,","Through which to God all mortal actions here,","And even the thoughts of men, do plain appear;","For from th' eternal truth it doth proceed,","Through heavenly virtue which her beams do breed.","","With the great glory of that wondrous light","His throne is all encompassed around,","And hid in his own brightness from the sight","Of all that look thereon with eyes unsound;","And underneath his feet are to be found","Thunder and lightning and tempestuous fire,","The instruments of his avenging ire.","","There in his bosom Sapience doth sit,","The sovereign darling of the Deity,","Clad like a queen in royal robes, most fit","For so great power and peerless majesty,","And all with gems and jewels gorgeously","Adorn'd, that brighter than the stars appear,","And make her native brightness seem more clear.","","And on her head a crown of purest gold","Is set, in sign of highest sovereignty;","And in her hand a sceptre she doth hold,","With which she rules the house of God on high,","And manageth the ever-moving sky,","And in the same these lower creatures all","Subjected to her power imperial.","","Both heaven and earth obey unto her will,","And all the creatures which they both contain;","For of her fullness which the world doth fill","They all partake, and do in state remain","As their great Maker did at first ordain,","Through observation of her high behest,","By which they first were made, and still increast.","","The fairness of her face no tongue can tell;","For she the daughters of all women's race,","And angels eke, in beauty doth excel,","Sparkled on her from God's own glorious face,","And more increas'd by her own goodly grace,","That it doth far exceed all human thought,","Ne can on earth compared be to aught.","","Ne could that painter (had he lived yet)","Which pictured Venus with so curious quill,","That all posterity admired it,","Have portray'd this, for all his mast'ring skill;","Ne she herself, had she remained still,","And were as fair as fabling wits do feign,","Could once come near this beauty sovereign.","","But had those wits, the wonders of their days,","Or that sweet Teian poet, which did spend","His plenteous vein in setting forth her praise,","Seen but a glimpse of this which I pretend,","How wondrously would he her face commend,","Above that idol of his feigning thought,","That all the world should with his rhymes be fraught.","","How then dare I, the novice of his art,","Presume to picture so divine a wight,","Or hope t' express her least perfection's part,","Whose beauty fills the heavens with her light,","And darks the earth with shadow of her sight?","Ah, gentle Muse, thou art too weak and faint","The portrait of so heavenly hue to paint.","","Let angels, which her goodly face behold","And see at will, her sovereign praises sing,","And those most sacred mysteries unfold","Of that fair love of mighty heaven's King;","Enough is me t' admire so heavenly thing,","And being thus with her huge love possest,","In th' only wonder of herself to rest.","","But whoso may, thrice happy man him hold,","Of all on earth whom God so much doth grace","And lets his own beloved to behold;","For in the view of her celestial face","All joy, all bliss, all happiness, have place;","Ne aught on earth can want unto the wight","Who of herself can win the wishful sight.","","For she, out of her secret treasury,","Plenty of riches forth on him will pour,","Even heavenly riches, which there hidden lie","Within the closet of her chastest bower,","Th' eternal portion of her precious dower,","Which mighty God hath given to her free,","And to all those which thereof worthy be.","","None thereof worthy be, but those whom she","Vouchsafeth to her presence to receive,","And letteth them her lovely face to see,","Whereof such wondrous pleasures they conceive,","And sweet contentment, that it doth bereave","Their soul of sense, through infinite delight,","And them transport from flesh into the spright.","","In which they see such admirable things,","As carries them into an ecstasy,","And hear such heavenly notes, and carollings","Of God's high praise, that fills the brazen sky;","And feel such joy and pleasure inwardly,","That maketh them all worldly cares forget,","And only think on that before them set.","","Ne from thenceforth doth any fleshly sense,","Or idle thought of earthly things, remain;","But all that erst seem'd sweet seems now offence,","And all that pleased erst now seems to pain;","Their joy, their comfort, their desire, their gain,","Is fixed all on that which now they see;","All other sights but feigned shadows be.","","And that fair lamp, which useth to inflame","The hearts of men with self-consuming fire","Thenceforth seems foul, and full of sinful blame;","And all that pomp to which proud minds aspire","By name of honour, and so much desire,","Seems to them baseness, and all riches dross,","And all mirth sadness, and all lucre loss.","","So full their eyes are of that glorious sight,","And senses fraught with such satiety,","That in nought else on earth they can delight,","But in th' aspect of that felicity,","Which they have written in their inward eye;","On which they feed, and in their fastened mind","All happy joy and full contentment find.","","Ah, then, my hungry soul, which long hast fed","On idle fancies of thy foolish thought,","And, with false beauty's flatt'ring bait misled,","Hast after vain deceitful shadows sought,","Which all are fled, and now have left thee nought","But late repentance through thy follies prief;","Ah cease to gaze on matter of thy grief:","","And look at last up to that sovereign light,","From whose pure beams all perfect beauty springs,","That kindleth love in every godly sprite,","Even the love of God, which loathing brings","Of this vile world and these gay-seeming things;","With whose sweet pleasures being so possest,","Thy straying thoughts henceforth for ever rest."],"linecount":"301"},{"title":"Epithalamion","author":"Edmund Spenser","lines":["YE learned sisters, which have oftentimes","Beene to me ayding, others to adorne,","Whom ye thought worthy of

Spenser","lines":["Rapt with the rage of mine own ravish'd thought,","Through contemplation of those goodly sights,","And glorious images in heaven wrought,","Whose wondrous beauty, breathing sweet delights","Do kindle love in high-conceited sprights;","I fain to tell the things that I behold,","But feel my wits to fail, and tongue to fold.","","Vouchsafe then, O thou most Almighty Spright,","From whom all gifts of wit and knowledge flow,","To shed into my breast some sparkling light","Of thine eternal truth, that I may show","Some little beams to mortal eyes below","Of that immortal beauty, there with thee,","Which in my weak distraughted mind I see;","","That with the glory of so goodly sight","The hearts of men, which fondly here admire","Fair seeming shews, and feed on vain delight,","Transported with celestial desire","Of those fair forms, may lift themselves up higher,","And learn to love, with zealous humble duty,","Th' eternal fountain of that heavenly beauty.","","Beginning then below, with th' easy view","Of this base world, subject to fleshly eye,","From thence to mount aloft, by order due,","To contemplation of th' immortal sky;","Of the soare falcon so I learn to fly,","That flags awhile her fluttering wings beneath,","Till she herself for stronger flight can breathe.","","Then look, who list thy gazeful eyes to feed","With sight of that is fair, look on the frame","Of this wide universe, and therein reed","The endless kinds of creatures which by name","Thou canst not count, much less their natures aim;","All which are made with wondrous wise respect,","And all with admirable beauty deckt.","","First th' earth, on adamantine pillars founded,","Amid the sea engirt with brazen bands;","Then th' air still flitting, but yet firmly bounded","On every side, with piles of flaming brands,","Never consum'd, nor quench'd with mortal hands;","And last, that mighty shining crystal wall,","Wherewith he hath encompassed this All.","","By view whereof it plainly may appear,","That still as every thing doth upward tend,","And further is from earth, so still more clear","And fair it grows, till to his perfect end","Of purest beauty it at last ascend;","Air more than water, fire much more than air,","And heaven than fire, appears more pure and fair.","","Look thou no further, but affix thine eye","On that bright, shiny, round, still moving mass,","The house of blessed gods, which men call sky,","All sow'd with glist'ring stars more thick than grass,","Whereof each other doth in brightness pass,","But those two most, which ruling night and day,","As king and queen, the heavens' empire sway;","","And tell me then, what hast thou ever seen","That to their beauty may compared be,","Or can the sight that is most sharp and keen","Endure their captain's flaming head to see?","How much less those, much higher in degree,","And so much fairer, and much more than these,","As these are fairer than the land and seas?","","For far above these heavens, which here we see,","Be others far exceeding these in light,","Not bounded, not corrupt, as these same be,","But infinite in largeness and in height,","Unmoving, uncorrupt, and spotless bright,","That need no sun t' illuminate their spheres,","But their own native light far passing theirs.","","And as these heavens still by degrees arise,","Until they come to their first Mover's bound,","That in his mighty compass doth comprise,","And carry all the rest with him around;","So those likewise do by degrees redound,","And rise more fair; till they at last arrive","To the most fair, whereto they all do strive.","","Fair is the heaven where happy souls have place,","In full enjoyment of felicity,","Whence they do still behold the glorious face","Of the divine eternal Majesty;","More fair is that, where those Ideas on high","Enranged be, which Plato so admired,","And pure Intelligences from God inspired.","","Yet fairer is that heaven, in which do reign","The sovereign Powers and mighty Potentates,","Which in their high protections do contain","All mortal princes and imperial states;","And fairer yet, whereas the royal Seats","And heavenly Dominations are set,","From whom all earthly governance is fet.","","Yet far more fair be those bright Cherubins,","Which all with golden wings are overdight,","And those eternal burning Seraphins,","Which from their faces dart out fiery light;","Yet fairer than they both, and much more bright,","Be th' Angels and Archangels, which attend","On God's own person, without rest or end.","","These thus in fair each other far excelling,","As to the highest they approach more near,","Yet is that highest far beyond all telling,","Fairer than all the rest which there appear,","Though all their beauties join'd together were;","How then can mortal tongue hope to express","The image of such endless perfectness?","","Cease then, my tongue, and lend unto my mind","Leave to bethink how great that beauty is,","Whose utmost parts so beautiful I find;","How much more those essential parts of his,","His truth, his love, his wisdom, and his bliss,","His grace, his doom, his mercy, and his might,","By which he lends us of himself a sight.","","Those unto all he daily doth display,","And shew himself in th' image of his grace,","As in a looking-glass, through which he may","Be seen of all his creatures vile and base,","That are unable else to see his face,","His glorious face which glistereth else so bright,","That th' Angels selves cannot endure his sight.","","But we, frail wights, whose sight cannot sustain","The sun's bright beams when he on us doth shine,","But that their points rebutted back again","Are dull'd, how can we see with feeble eyne","The glory of that Majesty Divine,","In sight of whom both sun and moon are dark,","Compared to his least resplendent spark?","","The means, therefore, which unto us is lent","Him to behold, is on his works to look,","Which he hath made in beauty excellent,","And in the same, as in a brazen book,","To read enregister'd in every nook","His goodness, which his beauty doth declare;","For all that's good is beautiful and fair.","","Thence gathering plumes of perfect speculation,","To imp the wings of thy high-flying mind,","Mount up aloft through heavenly contemplation,","From this dark world, whose damps the soul so blind,","And, like the native brood of eagles' kind,","On that bright Sun of Glory fix thine eyes,","Clear'd from gross mists of frail infirmities.","","Humbled with fear and awful reverence,","Before the footstool of his majesty","Throw thyself down, with trembling innocence,","Ne dare look up with corruptible eye","On the dread face of that great Deity,","For fear, lest if he chance to look on thee,","Thou turn to nought, and quite confounded be.","","But lowly fall before his mercy seat,","Close covered with the Lamb's integrity","From the just wrath of his avengeful threat","That sits upon the righteous throne on high;","His throne is built upon eternity,","More firm and durable than steel or brass,","Or the hard diamond, which them both doth pass.","","His sceptre is the rod of righteousness,","With which he bruiseth all his foes to dust,","And the great Dragon strongly doth repress,","Under the rigour of his judgement just;","His seat is truth, to which the faithful trust,","From whence proceed her beams so pure and bright","That all about him sheddeth glorious light:","","Light far exceeding that bright blazing spark","Which darted is from Titan's flaming head,","That with his beams enlumineth the dark","And dampish air, whereby all things are read;","Whose nature yet so much is marvelled","Of mortal wits, that it doth much amaze","The greatest wizards which thereon do gaze.","","But that immortal light, which there doth shine,","Is many thousand times more bright, more clear,","More excellent, more glorious, more divine,","Through which to God all mortal actions here,","And even the thoughts of men, do plain appear;","For from th' eternal truth it doth proceed,","Through heavenly virtue which her beams do breed.","","With the great glory of that wondrous light","His throne is all encompassed around,","And hid in his own brightness from the sight","Of all that look thereon with eyes unsound;","And underneath his feet are to be found","Thunder and lightning and tempestuous fire,","The instruments of his avenging ire.","","There in his bosom Sapience doth sit,","The sovereign darling of the Deity,","Clad like a queen in royal robes, most fit","For so great power and peerless majesty,","And all with gems and jewels gorgeously","Adorn'd, that brighter than the stars appear,","And make her native brightness seem more clear.","","And on her head a crown of purest gold","Is set, in sign of highest sovereignty;","And in her hand a sceptre she doth hold,","With which she rules the house of God on high,","And manageth the ever-moving sky,","And in the same these lower creatures all","Subjected to her power imperial.","","Both heaven and earth obey unto her will,","And all the creatures which they both contain;","For of her fullness which the world doth fill","They all partake, and do in state remain","As their great Maker did at first ordain,","Through observation of her high behest,","By which they first were made, and still increast.","","The fairness of her face no tongue can tell;","For she the daughters of all women's race,","And angels eke, in beauty doth excel,","Sparkled on her from God's own glorious face,","And more increas'd by her own goodly grace,","That it doth far exceed all human thought,","Ne can on earth compared be to aught.","","Ne could that painter (had he lived yet)","Which pictured Venus with so curious quill,","That all posterity admired it,","Have portray'd this, for all his mast'ring skill;","Ne she herself, had she remained still,","And were as fair as fabling wits do feign,","Could once come near this beauty sovereign.","","But had those wits, the wonders of their days,","Or that sweet Teian poet, which did spend","His plenteous vein in setting forth her praise,","Seen but a glimpse of this which I pretend,","How wondrously would he her face commend,","Above that idol of his feigning thought,","That all the world should with his rhymes be fraught.","","How then dare I, the novice of his art,","Presume to picture so divine a wight,","Or hope t' express her least perfection's part,","Whose beauty fills the heavens with her light,","And darks the earth with shadow of her sight?","Ah, gentle Muse, thou art too weak and faint","The portrait of so heavenly hue to paint.","","Let angels, which her goodly face behold","And see at will, her sovereign praises sing,","And those most sacred mysteries unfold","Of that fair love of mighty heaven's King;","Enough is me t' admire so heavenly thing,","And being thus with her huge love possest,","In th' only wonder of herself to rest.","","But whoso may, thrice happy man him hold,","Of all on earth whom God so much doth grace","And lets his own beloved to behold;","For in the view of her celestial face","All joy, all bliss, all happiness, have place;","Ne aught on earth can want unto the wight","Who of herself can win the wishful sight.","","For she, out of her secret treasury,","Plenty of riches forth on him will pour,","Even heavenly riches, which there hidden lie","Within the closet of her chastest bower,","Th' eternal portion of her precious dower,","Which mighty God hath given to her free,","And to all those which thereof worthy be.","","None thereof worthy be, but those whom she","Vouchsafeth to her presence to receive,","And letteth them her lovely face to see,","Whereof such wondrous pleasures they conceive,","And sweet contentment, that it doth bereave","Their soul of sense, through infinite delight,","And them transport from flesh into the spright.","","In which they see such admirable things,","As carries them into an ecstasy,","And hear such heavenly notes, and carollings","Of God's high praise, that fills the brazen sky;","And feel such joy and pleasure inwardly,","That maketh them all worldly cares forget,","And only think on that before them set.","","Ne from thenceforth doth any fleshly sense,","Or idle thought of earthly things, remain;","But all that erst seem'd sweet seems now offence,","And all that pleased erst now seems to pain;","Their joy, their comfort, their desire, their gain,","Is fixed all on that which now they see;","All other sights but feigned shadows be.","","And that fair lamp, which useth to inflame","The hearts of men with self-consuming fire","Thenceforth seems foul, and full of sinful blame;","And all that pomp to which proud minds aspire","By name of honour, and so much desire,","Seems to them baseness, and all riches dross,","And all mirth sadness, and all lucre loss.","","So full their eyes are of that glorious sight,","And senses fraught with such satiety,","That in nought else on earth they can delight,","But in th' aspect of that felicity,","Which they have written in their inward eye;","On which they feed, and in their fastened mind","All happy joy and full contentment find.","","Ah, then, my hungry soul, which long hast fed","On idle fancies of thy foolish thought,","And, with false beauty's flatt'ring bait misled,","Hast after vain deceitful shadows sought,","Which all are fled, and now have left thee nought","But late repentance through thy follies prief;","Ah cease to gaze on matter of thy grief:","","And look at last up to that sovereign light,","From whose pure beams all perfect beauty springs,","That kindleth love in every godly sprite,","Even the love of God, which loathing brings","Of this vile world and these gay-seeming things;","With whose sweet pleasures being so possest,","Thy straying thoughts henceforth for ever

dare the Conqueror disdain.","","","15","","Ye pallid spirits, and ye ashy ghosts,","Which joying in the brightness of your day,","Brought forth those signs of your premptuous boasts","Which now their dusty relics do bewray;","Tell me ye spirits (sith the darksome river","Of Styx not passable to souls returning,","Enclosing you in thrice three wards forever,","Do not restrain your images still mourning)","Tell me then (for perhaps some one of you","Yet here above him secretly doth hide)","Do ye not feel your torments to accrue,","When ye sometimes behold the ruin'd pride","Of these old Roman works built with your hands,","Now to become nought else, but heaped sands?","","","16","","Like as ye see the wrathful sea from far,","In a great mountain heap'd with hideous noise,","Eftsoons of thousand bilows shouldered narre,","Against a rock to break with dreadful poise;","Like as ye see fell Boreas with sharp blast,","Tossing huge tempests through the troubled sky,","Eftsoons having his wide wings spent in vast,","To stop his wearie carrier suddenly;","And as ye see huge flames spread diversly,","Gathered in one up to the heavens to spire,","Eftsoons consum'd to fall down feebily:","So whilom did this Monarchy aspire","As waves, as wind, as fire spread over all,","Till it by fatal doom adown did fall.","","","17","","So long as Jove's great bird did make his flight,","Bearing the fire with which heaven doth us fray,","Heaven had not fear of that presumptuous might,","With which the Giants did the Gods assay.","But all so soon, as scorching Sun had brent","His wings, which wont to the earth to overspread,","The earth out of her massy womb forth sent","That antique horror, which made heaven adread.","Then was the German raven in disguise","That Roman eagle seen to cleave asunder,","And towards heaven freshly to arise","Out of these mountains, not consum'd to powder.","In which the fowl that serves to bear the lightning,","Is now no more seen flying, nor alighting.","","","18","","These heaps of stones, these old walls which ye see,","Were first enclosures but of savage soil;","And these brave palaces which mastered be","Of time, were shepherds cottages somewhile.","Then took the shepherd kingly ornamnets","And the stout hynde arm'd his right hand with steel:","Eftsoones their rule of yearly presidents","Grew great, and six months greater a great deal;","Which made perpetual, rose to so great might,","That thence th' imperial Eagle rooting took,","Till th' heaven itself opposing 'gainst her might,","Her power to Peter's successor betook;","Who shepherdlike, (as fates the same forseeing)","Doth show, that all things turn to their first being.","","","19","","All that is perfect, which th' heaven beautifies;","All that's imperfect, born below the moon;","All that doth feed our spriits and our eyes;","And all that doth consume our pleasures soon;","All the mishap, the which our days outwears,","All the good hap of th' oldest times afore,","Rome in the time of her great ancesters,","Like a Pandora, locked long in store.","But destiny this huge Chaos turmoiling,","In which all good and evil was enclosed,","Their heavenly virtues from these woes absolving,","Carried to heaven, from sinful bondage loosed:","But their great sins, the causers of their pain,","Under these antique ruins yet remain.","","","20","","No otherwise than rainy cloud, first fed","With earthly vapors gathered in the air,","Eftsoones in compass arch'd, to steep his head,","Doth plunge himself in Tethys' bosom fair;","And mounting up again, from whence he came,","With his great belly spreads the dimmed world,","Till at last the last dissolving his moist frame,","In rain, or snow, or hail he forth is hurl'd;","This City, which was first but shepherds' shade,","Uprising by degrees, grew to such height,","That queen of land and sea herself she made.","At last not able to bear so great weight.","Her power dispers'd, through all the world did vade;","To show that all in th' end to nought shall fade.","","","21","","The same which Pyrrhus, and the puissance","Of Afric could not tame, that same brave city,","Which with stout courage arm'd against mischance,","Sustain'd the shock of common enmity;","Long as her ship tossed with so many freaks,","Had all the world in arms against her bent,","Was never seen, that any fortune's wreaks","Could break her course begun with brave intent.","But when the object of her virtue failed,","Her power itself agains itself did arm;","As he that having long in tempest sailed,","Fain would arrive, but cannot for the storm,","If too great wind against the port him drive,","Doth in the port itself his vessel rive.","","","22","","When that brave honour of the Latin name,","Which bound her rule with Africa, and Byze,","With Thames' inhabitants of noble fame,","And they which see the dawning day arise;","Her nurslings did with mutinous uproar","Hearten against herself, her conquer'd spoil,","Which she had won from all the world afore,","Of all the world was spoil'd within a while.","So when the compass'd course of the universe","In six and thirty thousand years is run,","The bands of th' elements shall back reverse","To their first discord, and be quite undone:","The seeds, of which all things at first were bred,","Shall in great Chaos' womb again be hid.","","","23","","O wary wisdom of the man, that would","That Carthage towers from spoil should be forborn,","To th' end that his victorious people should","With cankering leisure not be overworn;","He well foresaw, how that the Roman courage,","Impatient of pleasure's faint desires,","Through idleness would turn to civil rage,","And be herself the matter of her fires.","For in a people given all to ease,","Ambition is engend'red easily;","As in a vicious body, gross disease","Soon grows through humours' superfluity.","That came to pass, when swoll'n with plentious pride,","Nor prince, nor peer, nor kin they would abide.","","","24","","If the blind fury, which wars breedeth oft,","Wonts not t' enrage the hearts of equal beasts,","Whether they fare on foot, or fly aloft,","Or arméd be with claws, or scaly crests;","What fell Erynnis with hot burning tongs,","Did grip your hearts, with noisome rage imbew'd,","That each to other working cruel wrongs,","You blades in your own bowels you embrew'd?","Was this (ye Romans) your hard destiny?","Or some old sin, whose unappeased guilt","Power'd vengeance forth on you eternally?","Or brother's blood, the which at first was spilt","Upon your walls, that God might not endure,","Upon the same to set foundation sure?","","","25","","O that I had the Thracian Poet's harp,","For to awake out of th' infernal shade","Those antique Cæsars, sleeping long in dark,","The which this ancient City whilome made:","Or that I had Amphion's instrument,","To quicken with his vital note's accord,","The stony joints of these old walls now rent,","By which th' Ausonian light might be restor'd:","Or that at least I could with pencil fine,","Fashion the portraits of these palaces,","By pattern of great Virgil's spirit divine;","I would assay with that which in me is,","To build with level of my lofty style,","That which no hands can evermore compile.","","","26","","Who list the Roman greatness forth to figure,","Him needeth not to seek for usage right","Of line, or lead, or rule, or square, to measure","Her length, her breadth, her deepness, or her height:","But him behooves to view in compass round","All that the ocean grasps in his long arms;","Be it where the yearly star doth scorch the ground,","Or where cold Boreas blows his bitter storms.","Rome was th' whole world, and all the world was Rome,","And if things nam'd their names do equalize,","When land and sea ye name, then name ye Rome;","And naming Rome ye land and sea comprise:","For th' ancient plot of Rome displayéd plain,","The map of all the wide world doth contain.","","","27","","Thou that at Rome astonish'd dost behold","The antique pride, which menaced the sky,","These haughty heaps, these palaces of old,","These walls, these arcs, these baths, these temples hie;","Judge by these ample ruins' view, the rest","The which injurious time hath quite outworne,","Since of all workmen held in reck'ning best,","Yet these old fragments are for patterns born:","Then also mark, how Rome from day to day,","Repairing her decayéd fashion,","Renews herself with buildings rich and gay;","That one would judge, that the Roman dæmon","Doth yet himself with fatal hand enforce,","Again on foot to rear her pouldred corse.","","","28","","He that hath seen a great oak dry and dead,","Yet clad with relics of some trophies old,","Lifting to heaven her agéd hoary head,","Whose foot in ground hath left but feeble hold;","But half disbowel'd lies above the ground,","Showing her wreathéd roots, and naked arms,","And on her trunk all rotten and unsound","Only supports herself for meat of worms;","And though she owe her fall to the first wind,","Yet of the devout people is ador'd,","And many young plants spring out of her rind;","Who such an oak hath seen let him record","That such this city's honor was of yore,","And 'mongst all cities flourishéd much more.","","","29","","All that which Egypt whilome did devise,","All that which Greece their temples to embrave,","After th' Ionic, Attic, Doric guise,","Or Corinth skill'd in curious works to 'grave;","All that Lysippus' practick art could form,","Appeles' wit, or Phidias his skill,","Was wont this ancient city to adorn,","And the heaven itself with her wide wonders fill;","All that which Athens ever brought forth wise,","All that which Africa ever brought forth strange,","All that which Asia ever had of prize,","Was here to see. O marvelous great change:","Rome living, was the world's sole ornament,","And dead, is now the world's sole monument.","","","30","","Like as the seeded field green grass first shows,","Then from green grass into a stalk doth spring,","And from a stalk into an ear forth grows,","Which ear the fruitfull grain doth shortly bring;","And as in season due the husband mows","The waving locks of those fair yellow hairs,","Which bound in sheaves, and laid in comely rows,","Upon the naked fields in stacks he rears:","So grew the Roman Empire by degree,","Till that barbarian hands it quite did

Beauty","author":"Edmund Spenser","lines":["AH whither, Love, wilt thou now carry me?","What wontless fury dost thou now inspire","Into my feeble breast, too full of thee?","Whilst seeking to aslake thy raging fire,","Thou in me kindlest much more great desire,","And up aloft above my strength dost raise","The wondrous matter of my fire to praise.","","That as I erst in praise of thine own name,","So now in honour of thy mother dear,","An honourable hymn I eke should frame,","And with the brightness of her beauty clear,","The ravish'd hearts of gazeful men might rear","To admiration of that heavenly light,","From whence proceeds such soul-enchanting might.","","Thereto do thou, great goddess, queen of beauty,","Mother of love, and of all world's delight,","Without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty","Nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sight,","Do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light","T' illuminate my dim and dulled eyne,","And beautify this sacred hymn of thine:","","That both to thee, to whom I mean it most,","And eke to her, whose fair immortal beam","Hath darted fire into my feeble ghost,","That now it wasted is with woes extreme,","It may so please, that she at length will stream","Some dew of grace into my withered heart,","After long sorrow and consuming smart.","","WHAT time this world's great Workmaster did cast","To make all things such as we now behold,","It seems that he before his eyes had plac'd","A goodly pattern, to whose perfect mould","He fashion'd them as comely as he could;","That now so fair and seemly they appear,","As nought may be amended anywhere.","","That wondrous pattern, wheresoe'er it be,","Whether in earth laid up in secret store,","Or else in heaven, that no man may it see","With sinful eyes, for fear it to deflore,","Is perfect Beauty, which all men adore;","Whose face and feature doth so much excel","All mortal sense, that none the same may tell.","","Thereof as every earthly thing partakes","Or more or less, by influence divine,","So it more fair accordingly it makes,","And the gross matter of this earthly mine,","Which clotheth it, thereafter doth refine,","Doing away the dross which dims the light","Of that fair beam which therein is empight.","","For, through infusion of celestial power,","The duller earth it quick'neth with delight,","And lifeful spirits privily doth pour","Through all the parts, that to the looker's sight","They seem to please. That is thy sovereign might,","O Cyprian queen, which flowing from the beam","Of thy bright star, thou into them dost stream.","","That is the thing which giveth pleasant grace","To all things fair, that kindleth lively fire,","Light of thy lamp, which, shining in the face,","Thence to the soul darts amorous desire,","And robs the hearts of those which it admire;","Therewith thou pointest thy son's poison'd arrow,","That wounds the life, and wastes the inmost marrow.","","How vainly then do idle wits invent,","That beauty is nought else but mixture made","Of colours fair, and goodly temp'rament","Of pure complexions, that shall quickly fade","And pass away, like to a summer's shade;","Or that it is but comely composition","Of parts well measur'd, with meet disposition.","","Hath white and red in it such wondrous power,","That it can pierce through th' eyes unto the heart,","And therein stir such rage and restless stour,","As nought but death can stint his dolour's smart?","Or can proportion of the outward part","Move such affection in the inward mind,","That it can rob both sense and reason blind?","","Why do not then the blossoms of the field,","Which are array'd with much more orient hue,","And to the sense most dainty odours yield,","Work like impression in the looker's view?","Or why do not fair pictures like power shew,","In which oft-times we nature see of art","Excell'd, in perfect limning every part?","","But ah, believe me, there is more than so,","That works such wonders in the minds of men;","I, that have often prov'd, too well it know,","And whoso list the like assays to ken,","Shall find by trial, and confess it then,","That beauty is not, as fond men misdeem,","An outward shew of things, that only seem.","","For that same goodly hue of white and red,","With which the cheeks are sprinkled, shall decay,","And those sweet rosy leaves, so fairly spread","Upon the lips, shall fade and fall away","To that they were, even to corrupted clay;","That golden wire, those sparkling stars so bright,","Shall turn to dust; and lose their goodly light.","","But that fair lamp, from whose celestial ray","That light proceeds, which kindleth lovers' fire,","Shall never be extinguish'd nor decay;","But when the vital spirits do expire,","Unto her native planet shall retire;","For it is heavenly born and cannot die,","Being a parcel of the purest sky.","","For when the soul, the which derived was,","At first, out of that great immortal Spright,","By whom all live to love, whilom did pass","Down from the top of purest heaven's height","To be embodied here, it then took light","And lively spirits from that fairest star,","Which lights the world forth from his fiery car.","","Which power retaining still or more or less,","When she in fleshly seed is eft enraced,","Through every part she doth the same impress,","According as the heavens have her graced,","And frames her house, in which she will be placed,","Fit for herself, adorning it with spoil","Of th' heavenly riches which she robb'd erewhile.","","Thereof it comes that these fair souls, which have","The most resemblance of that heavenly light,","Frame to themselves most beautiful and brave","Their fleshly bower, most fit for their delight,","And the gross matter by a sovereign might","Tempers so trim, that it may well be seen","A palace fit for such a virgin queen.","","So every spirit, as it is most pure,","And hath in it the more of heavenly light,","So it the fairer body doth procure","To habit in, and it more fairly dight","With cheerful grace and amiable sight.","For of the soul the body form doth take:","For soul is form, and doth the body make.","","Therefore wherever that thou dost behold","A comely corpse, with beauty fair endued,","Know this for certain, that the same doth hold","A beauteous soul, with fair conditions thewed,","Fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed.","For all that fair is, is by nature good;","That is a sign to know the gentle blood.","","Yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind","Dwells in deformed tabernacle drown'd,","Either by chance, against the course of kind,","Or through unaptness in the substance found,","Which it assumed of some stubborn ground,","That will not yield unto her form's direction,","But is deform'd with some foul imperfection.","","And oft it falls, (ay me, the more to rue)","That goodly beauty, albe heavenly born,","Is foul abus'd, and that celestial hue,","Which doth the world with her delight adorn,","Made but the bait of sin, and sinners' scorn,","Whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it,","But every one doth seek but to deprave it.","","Yet nathëmore is that fair beauty's blame,","But theirs that do abuse it unto ill:","Nothing so good, but that through guilty shame","May be corrupt, and wrested unto will:","Natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still,","However flesh{\"e}s fault it filthy make;","For things immortal no corruption take.","","But ye fair dames, the world's dear ornaments","And lively images of heaven's light,","Let not your beams with such disparagements","Be dimm'd, and your bright glory dark'ned quite;","But mindful still of your first country's sight,","Do still preserve your first informed grace,","Whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face.","","Loathe that foul blot, that hellish firebrand,","Disloyal lust, fair beauty's foulest blame,","That base affections, which your ears would bland,","Commend to you by love's abused name,","But is indeed the bondslave of defame;","Which will the garland of your glory mar,","And quench the light of your bright shining star.","","But gentle Love, that loyal is and true,","Will more illumine your resplendent ray,","And add more brightness to your goodly hue,","From light of his pure fire; which, by like way","Kindled of yours, your likeness doth display;","Like as two mirrors, by oppos'd reflection,","Do both express the face's first impression.","","Therefore, to make your beauty more appear,","It you behoves to love, and forth to lay","That heavenly riches which in you ye bear,","That men the more admire their fountain may;","For else what booteth that celestial ray,","If it in darkness be enshrined ever,","That it of loving eyes be viewed never?","","But, in your choice of loves, this well advise,","That likest to yourselves ye them select,","The which your forms' first source may sympathize,","And with like beauty's parts be inly deckt;","For, if you loosely love without respect,","It is no love, but a discordant war,","Whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar.","","For love is a celestial harmony","Of likely hearts compos'd of stars' concent,","Which join together in sweet sympathy,","To work each other's joy and true content,","Which they have harbour'd since their first descent","Out of their heavenly bowers, where they did see","And know each other here belov'd to be.","","Then wrong it were that any other twain","Should in love's gentle band combined be","But those whom Heaven did at first ordain,","And made out of one mould the more t' agree;","For all that like the beauty which they see,","Straight do not love; for love is not so light","As straight to burn at first beholder's sight.","","But they, which love indeed, look otherwise,","With pure regard and spotless true intent,","Drawing out of the object of their eyes","A more refined form, which they present","Unto their mind, void of all blemishment;","Which it reducing to her first perfection,","Beholdeth free from flesh's frail infection.","","And then conforming it unto the light,","Which in itself it hath remaining still,","Of that first Sun, yet sparkling in his sight,","Thereof he fashions in his higher skill","An heavenly beauty to his fancy's will;","And it embracing in his mind entire,","The mirror of his own thought doth admire.","","Which seeing now so inly fair to be,","As outward it appeareth to the eye,","And with his spirit's proportion to agree,","He thereon fixeth all his fantasy,","And fully setteth his felicity;","Counting it fairer than it is indeed,","And yet indeed her fairness doth exceed.","","For lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be","Than other men's, and in dear love's delight","See more than any other eyes can see,","Through mutual receipt of beam{\"e}s bright,","Which carry privy message to the spright,","And to their eyes that inmost fair display,","As plain as light discovers dawning day.","","Therein they see, through amorous eye-glances,","Armies of loves still flying to and fro,","Which dart at them their little fiery lances;","Whom having wounded, back again they go,","Carrying compassion to their lovely foe;","Who, seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect,","Cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect.","","In which how many wonders do they rede","To their conceit, that others never see,","Now of her smiles, with which their souls they feed,","Like gods with nectar in their banquets free;","Now of her looks, which like to cordials be;","But when her words' embássade forth she sends,","Lord, how sweet music that unto them lends.","","Sometimes upon her forehead they behold","A thousand graces masking in delight;","Sometimes within her eyelids they unfold","Ten thousand sweet belgards, which to their sight","Do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night;","But on her lips, like rosy buds in May,","So many millions of chaste pleasures play.","","All those, O Cytherea, and thousands more","Thy handmaids be, which do on thee attend,","To deck thy beauty with their dainties' store,","That may it more to mortal eyes commend,","And make it more admir'd of foe and friend:","That in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install,","And spread thy lovely kingdom over all.","","Then Iö, triumph! O great Beauty's Queen,","Advance the banner of thy conquest high,","That all this world, the which thy vassals bene,","May draw to thee, and with due fealty","Adore the power of thy great majesty,","Singing this hymn in honour of thy name,","Compil'd by me, which thy poor liegeman am.","","In lieu whereof grant, O great sovereign,","That she whose conquering beauty doth captive","My trembling heart in her eternal chain,","One drop of grace at length will to me give,","That I her bounden thrall by her may live,","And this same life, which first fro me she reaved,","May owe to her,

All new and strange","The universe turned stranger, for a child.","Then, land ! -- then, England ! oh, the frosty cliffs","Looked cold upon me. Could I find a home","Among those mean red houses through the fog ?","And when I heard my father's language first","From alien lips which had no kiss for mine","I wept aloud, then laughed, then wept, then wept,","And some one near me said the child was mad","Through much sea-sickness.

Did Shakspeare and his mates","Absorb the light here ? -- not a hill or stone","With heart to strike a radiant colour up","Or active outline on the indifferent air.","I think I see my father's sister stand","Upon the hall-step of her country-house","To give me welcome.

She had lived","A sort of cage-bird life, born in a cage,","Accounting that to leap from perch to perch","Was act and joy enough for any bird.","Dear heaven, how silly are the things that live","In thickets, and eat berries !","I, alas,","A wild bird scarcely fledged, was brought to her cage,","And she was there to meet me. Very kind.","Bring the clean water, give out the fresh seed.","She stood upon the steps to welcome me,","Calm, in black garb. I clung about her neck, --","Young babes, who catch at every shred of wool","To draw the new light closer, catch and cling","Less blindly. In my ears, my father's word","Hummed ignorantly, as the sea in shells,","`Love, love, my child.' She, black there with my grief,","Might feel my love -- she was his sister once,","I clung to her. A moment, she seemed moved,","Kissed me with cold lips, suffered me to cling,","And drew me feebly through the hall into","The room she sate in.","There, with some strange spasm","Of pain and passion, she wrung loose my hands","Imperiously, and held me at arm's length,","And with two grey-steel naked-bladed eyes","Searched through my face, -- ay, stabbed it through and through,","Through brows and cheeks and chin, as if to find","A wicked murderer in my innocent face,","If not here, there perhaps. Then, drawing breath,","She struggled for her ordinary calm","And missed it rather, -- told me not to shrink,","As if she had told me not to lie or swear, --","`She loved my father, and would love me too","As long as I deserved it.'
